            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the holy reformed Churches of Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Germany, &amp; France, grace &amp; peace from God our father, &amp; from Ieſus-Chriſt our Lord.</head>
            <p>Thincke it not ſtrange, o moſt holy ſpouſe of Chriſt, that a new interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apocalyps is preſented unto thee: conſidering that among ſo many both of olde &amp; late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is the judgement of all, that the Revelation, needeth ſtil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Revelation: and that theſe wordes be continually ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in thyne eares, The Lord hath ſpoken, who shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy? For the Lord hath not onely ſpoken of old by dreames &amp; viſions, but alſo he ſpeaketh daily, ſo often as he vouchſafeth to illuminate the mindes of his ſervaunts, for to manifeſt the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truth of his word, &amp; to expoſe the ſame openly. And with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God doeth thus communicate, he thincketh that neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is laid upon him, for to manifeſt unto others, that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath receaved. And in deed, should the candel be lightned for to be putt under a bushell? should the comon danger of all, be privily declared for the benefitt of one onely? Is it not rather for this, that being put in the watch tower, he muſt give warning to the reſt, for to avoide with all ſpeed the preſent danger? The Lepers knew this well, &amp; they could ſay, that if they had kept the joyfull tydings untill the daye light, evel should have come upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. But what and if any should conceale the eminent danger, of what punishment should he be guilty? Verely of ſo much the more greater as the difference is between one altogether loſt, and one that is deprived of joy but for a few houres. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learned from this Apocalyps, that shortly a great tentation shall invade all Chriſtendome, in ſo much as the ſword of the Lord shall be made droncken in heaven, &amp; all the hoſt of them shall be overthrowne, &amp; that you, the Chriſtian Churches of Germany, France, &amp; Britanny, are by name favorably admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of this tempeſt by written Epiſtles: I finding by the will of
<pb facs="tcp:6819:3"/> God theſe Epiſtles which doe shew this thing, &amp; underſtanding by the inſcriptions, to whom they were written, I durſt not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doe, but to render them, to whom they belong: leaſt by the intercepting &amp; keeping of them ſecret by me, I should both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traye your welfare, and be condemned as guilty of treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. There is no godly man but he ſeeth, that the Divine worship deſpiſed, the moſt holy word of God derided, the great ſecuritye &amp; pride of the Paſtors, &amp; the altogether corrupt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute maners of all, of whas order and condition ſoever they be, doe foretell of ſome horrible calamitye shortly to come. Now theſe Epiſtles doe not foretell the thing by ambiguous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>jecture, but by moſt plaine wordes doe teach a goulf full of miſeries to be at hand &amp; readye to invade us. Thou ſpouſe, ſee, I pray thee, the ſeale, knowe the hand, the wordes, the ſtyle of the writter,; thou knoweſt well the voice of the Bridgroome: yf the letters be ſent unto thee by him, as they doe shewe, it is more then tyme to caſt off thoſe defylements, which thou haſt drawen to thy ſelf, by a to much &amp; to long ſecuritye, leaſt otherwiſe yf thou continue to be negligent unto this thing, thou maieſt at the laſt be ſuddenly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with great ſorowe by the fyre of the refyner. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding leaſt thou shouldſt thinck that I bring onely ſuch great ſorowe &amp; morning, beholde alſo a great joye &amp; a great triomphe. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this tempeſt shall preſently followe joyfull dayes, &amp; greatly to be deſired; for what can be more pleaſant unto the chaſte ſpouſe, driven out by the Romish whore (vvho vauntes her ſelf to be the true vvyffe) &amp; by the ſame vexed ſo manye aages by all maner of contumelies &amp; in juries, then to ſee finally that impudent harlott, her noſe ſlit, ſpoiled of her clothing &amp; ornaments, defiled vvith dung &amp; adle egges; &amp; finally butnt &amp; conſumed by fyre? Lift up thyne eares a little &amp; receave of this Prophecy, not ſome obſcure ſignes, but moſt certen arguments of the Bridgroomes short co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to avenge thy greif, &amp; deliver into thine hands the vvhore, that thou maieſt poure out upon her all the heat of jelouſie. And for the increaſe of thy joy, receave vvithall the laſt deſtruction of the Turcks, ſoone follovving the deſtruction of Rome, for this
<pb facs="tcp:6819:3"/> muſt firſt be abolished, the fevvell onely &amp; matter of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tiranny of them, the ſinevves of vvhich shall altogither be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved &amp; cutt off, after that Chriſtendome shall be purged by an exceeding great deſtruction of her, of her hainous vvickedneſſes, as the Apocalyps plainely shevveth. And that thy joy maie be full, knovve alſo the uniting together of the Ievves vvith the Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian nations: and ſo unto the end a moſt happy tranquillitie. Thinges indeede very great, &amp; greatly to be admyred, parte vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath already bin manifeſted in ſome ſorte to the Chriſtian Church, in ſo much as vvas fitting thoſe tymes, yet far from the end of the Prophecy, unto vvhich approching, is reſerved a more full knovvledge: the other parte is ſo ſtrange &amp; ſo unexpected, as I could not ever finde in any, not ſo much as a probable ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it out of this Apocalyps. All vvhich effects notvvithſtanding, vvill yeilde unto us this nevv centurie of tymes vvhich novv vve enter into, as our expoſition, yf I be not deceaved, doth make plaine. For novv is begun the laſt acte of a moſt long &amp; moſt dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tragedie, vvhich shall overflovv vvith ſcourges, deaths, ruines: But this Scene being removed, shall come in the place of it the pleaſant proſpect of a perpetuall peace, accompanied vvith abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all good things. Thus then thou haſt, moſt deare Spouſe of Chriſt, the reſidue of the courſe of thy vvarrfarre, ſtand novv in the hatches, &amp; after long toſſing, at lenght beholde the Iand; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the cloude ſeen a farre of hath deceaved thee, but novv be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the ſea shore, &amp; knovv the mouth of the haven it ſelf. Let thy eies judge, vvhether I be vvorthie, to vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the revvard of good nevves be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For ſo farr of is it, that I thinke that vve muſt ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the judgement of Rome alone, as I hope I vvill convince by ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſarie arguments, that she is altogether by Gods juſt judgement bereft of her lightes; vvherby at length shee shall ſodainly rush into eternall deſtruction</p>
            <p>Therefore let her minde &amp; judge theſe things as she pleaſeth, she shall knovv shortly, vvhat it is, by her inchantments, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave her ſelf &amp; others. Thou in the meane vvhile, o naturall Spouſe, be mindfull of the tempeſt at hand, &amp; prepare thy ſelf for
<pb facs="tcp:6819:4"/> it; hale in the shoote, be carefull of the helm, look to plie the pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe; leaſt in the entrance of the haven, vvhich God forbidde, thou make shipvvrake. And novv ſee hovv very acceptable this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ought to be to thee, not onely for the future events of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great moment indeede, but alſo in regarde of the memorie paſt: to vvhich if thou shalt turne thine eies, thou shalt ſee even from the Apoſtles times, that, that continuall path, in vvhich thou haſt ſet thy foote ſteppes, hath beene marked out vvith ſo plaine paternes, as thou need deſire no plainer hiſtorie; &amp; alſo thou shalt enjoie a moſt pleaſant remembrance of the dangers vvhich thou haſt fuffred, vvhich yeilde unto thee ſo many arguments of the in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vviſdom, love, truth of God, keeping thee ſafe amidſt great diſtreſſes. Surely this addition vvith the reſt of the Apoſtolicall vvritings adjoined to the old Teſtament, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth Hiſtories of the vvorlde it ſelf from the firſt beginning unto the latter end thereof: for vvhich cauſe this uneſtimable treaſure ought to be to every one moſt deare. And theſe are the cauſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, o Chriſtian Churches, of my publicke vvriting: There are alſo ſome cauſes that concerne the Prelacie, namely, mercy &amp; vvrath: mercy becauſe I ſavv many ignorant rude and unskilfull in the heavenly truth, as yet to vvorship Antichriſt as a God. Thoſe vvere to be taken out of the javves of hell, yf ſo it should pleaſe God. For vvhich thing I vvill go before to shine un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them vvith ſo great plainenes of truth, that they shall neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſee, ſo that they vvill open their eies, that, that Prelate of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me is that man of ſinne, to vvhom yf they perſevere to cleave, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaved. Truly my indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is kindled againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuites: For vvhen by happe I fell on Ribera interpreting this ſame holy Revelation: Doe, ſaied I, the Papiſts againe take courage, that that booke vvhich of late they permitted ſcarce any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to touch, they should novv undertake the full handling thereof? Was it a vaine shevv at the ſight vvhereof, yea in dimme light, a fevv yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res agoe they trembled, that novv they boldely endure to looke in to the ſame glaſſe, &amp; crie out that ſome other thing is shevved in it then their Pope? O vve drovvſy men &amp; ſluggards if vve ſuffer it!
<pb facs="tcp:6819:4"/> Therfore I thought that their croaking is in ſome ſorte to be reſtrained, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming that it would be worth the labour, to shew to the Ieſuites, how wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly they are madde, how fooliſhly they trifle, how they underſtand none of theſe Myſteries, how it cannot be, that here they ſhould be any thing weiſe; that if they deſire the truth, as they make a ſhewe, at leaſt weiſe they may have mee a helper to ſearch it out; or if otherweiſe they doe yet deſpiſe it being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, an aprouver of their condemnation. But yf they will not be ſilent, for I know that for a ſhort time they shall fill heaven and earth with their noiſe; yet I hope to have given that force of light, wherby they being hereafter bereft of all shew of reaſons, they shall vomit forth no other thing, then their mere blaſphemies againſt God and men.

                  <hi>¶ Which God gave unto him;</hi> To wit, the Father, the authour &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne of all things.

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And he ſignifyed:</hi> That is, <hi>which alſo he ſignifyed, when he had ſent by his Angell to his ſervante John:</hi> Twoo inſtrumentall cauſes are rehearſed, the <hi>Angell and Iohn.</hi> Chriſt uſeth his miniſtery, not becauſe he diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe to ſpeake to us (for he giveth himſelf to be ſeene in his owne perſon in this very chapter:) but becauſe both our weaknes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the beholding of ſo great maieſty, as it appeareth by and by after in <hi>John,</hi> who <hi>fell downe dead at the ſight of him,</hi> ver. 17. And alſo that he may shewe, that he doth rule and commande to the Angels and all other thinges.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Who bare record:,</hi> As touching <hi>John,</hi> he deſcribeth playnly himſelfe unto us, shewing that he is no other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle himſelfe: of which two certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and proper markes are rehearſed, one the <hi>teſtimony given to the word of God and to Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The other, <hi>an eye beleefe of thoſe thinges which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6819:11"/> he teſtifyed:</hi> For Chriſt choſe twelve out of all his Diſciples, who should be with him continually, and should be preſent at all his miracles and conferences, <hi>of which they ſhould be witneſſes afterward even unto the furtheſt parts of the earth,</hi> Act. 1.8. by which double marke Luke doth note them out, writing thus, <hi>Who from the beginning were beholders themſelves and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word,</hi> Chap. 1.2. By which arguments alſo Iohn himſelfe doth maintaine his authority in an other place: <hi>That which we have heard, which we have ſeene with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our handes have handled of the word of lyfe,</hi> 1 Ioh. 1.1. And the thinges ſeen which are here mentioned are not the viſions of this booke which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, but the <hi>actes and miracles of Chriſt,</hi> at which whyle they were done, Iohn was preſent. Otherwiſe howe could thoſe thinges have procured authority to the writer (which thing onely the mentioning of theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth in this place) which were not yet made knowne to the Church? Wherfore, that <hi>John,</hi> who wrote the Revelation, was the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> unto whom thoſe markes doe agree, by which the Apoſtles were knowen &amp; famous in the Church above others: neither is there any other <hi>John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, to whom theſe ſame thinges can agree. And indeede he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelfe to be ſuch, by very good adviſe, when as it would be very much avaylable for the credit of the Prophecy, that men should be perſwaded of the authority of him that did write it.</p>
               <p>I mervayle therefore, that <hi>Dionyſius of Alexandria</hi> regarded theſe things ſo little, that he would diſpute againſt them ſo egerly. But his foolish coniectures have bene confuted by others moſt leardnedly. He then being let paſſe: from hence it may be underſtood, that thoſe wordes, which Aretas teſtifyeth to be added herein in ſome bookes, &amp; wee ſee to have ben put in by Plantine and Montanus out of the Compluten tranſlation, <hi>And whatſoever he heard, and whatſoever thinges are, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever muſt be done hereafter,</hi> that theſe words, I ſay, have crept in wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and into an unmeet place: for thinges not knowne have no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority themſelves, much leſſe can they bring it to an other.</p>

In deede Frauncis of Ribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra the Ieſuite doth thruſt togither this whole Prophecy almoſt into theſe narrowe ſtraites, prudently verily, as touching his Pope, but in reſpect of the truth it ſelfe, very perverſly. For were men utterly voyd of this felicity, by the ſpace of thoſe whole thouſande five hundred yeares which are now paſt, ſince the Revelation was given? Or can any be happy eyther in reading, or keeping thoſe things which perteine no thing to him? If all theſe thinges are to be thruſt into this three yeeres ſpace, they shall in no wiſe be <hi>bleſſed.</hi> But they have bin curious in vaine who eyther hitherto have ſearched out thoſe things, or have uſed dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce in effecting them. Which ſame thing muſt needes alſo come to paſſe in future tymes, wee know not for the ſpace of howe many ages. But the whole handling of the thinge shall convince this invention, eyther of very great fraude, or ignorance and unskilfulnes. Let us know in the meane tyme that ſuch a fruite is here prayſed, which is common to all ages ſince this divine Revelation came forth to be ſeen of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which sheweth ſeverally and one after an other the condition of every tyme, even unto the laſt ende, as shall be manifeſted with God his helpe, by this expoſition of ours.</p>

                  <hi>¶ For the tyme is at hand.</hi> Wherin theſe thinhs shalbe put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. But ſeeing the whole prophecy doth denounce a battaile, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then put on a crowne, the reaſon ſeemeth to be fetched from the danger nigh at hand, as though he should ſay, bleſſed are they that are fortified with ſome firme aide againſt the evils ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging over their heads. But huge great evils ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de at the doores, of which this prophecy is full: therefore they are bleſſed that shall take heed and keepe faithfully the way of eſcaping them.</p>

They to whom he writeth, are <hi>the ſeaven Churches</hi> in Aſia, that is, the univerſall Churches in every place, as Aretas and Beda doe well affirme, and all, as I thinke, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters with one conſent, doe iudge. Neither can invery deede the thinges here rehearſed, beare to be reſtrained to theſe ſeaven Churches. We shall heare in the Epiſtles ſent to every one, an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all should heare what things were written to the Churches.

And the laſt concluſion of the whole booke, which wished <hi>the grace of Chriſt to them all,</hi> shewes that this whole Prophecy was ſent to the ſeaven Churches for an Epiſtle, chap. 22.21. But wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hereunto is added that the nomber of ſeaven is an univerſall nomber, by whoſe revolution all times are made, all times being winded upon this Pole, even as the whole heavenlie frame is turned upon the ſeaven ſtarres. Wherefore, as being full of myſterie, it is uſed afterward the whole booke through in deſcribing of all things. Yet <hi>all Churches</hi> are not ſo to be conſidered, as yf nothing indeede had bene ſent to them, which by name are afterward noted, but togither with the ſignification of the miſterie, the truth of the hiſtorie is to be reteined. Seing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe ſeaven Churches ſtretch further than their names declare, whether in them the eſtate of all times even to Chriſtes comming is to be conſidered? No verily, but onely of that time, wherein the Church shalbe among the Gentiles. Which thing shalbe manifeſt by thoſe things that follow, and alſo ſo plaine a deſciphering of the <hi>Churches of Aſia</hi> ſeemes to grant, that the Synagogue of the Iewes is not to be mixt with them. Which thing hath cauſed, that in the reſolution, we have diſtinguished the whole Propheticall narration, into that which is proper to particular Churches, and into that which is common to all Churches.</p>

For there is the ſame force of this circumlocution, as of that abreviation Exod. 3.4. which we know was uſed, that he might teach Moſes that the time was come, that he woulde perfourme the promiſe once made to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of delivering his ſeed out of Egipt. From whence is alſo that name of <hi>Iehova, wherby God was not knowne to the Fathers,</hi> Exod. 6.2. becauſe they had not yet obteined that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

Wherefore theſe things are as yf he should ſay, <hi>From God the Father moſt true and conſtant in all his things: which preſently giueth moſt plentifull experiments of his truth, by ſending at length his Sonne into the world, who in former times never failed in any one of thoſe things which he had promiſed, who laſtly ſo hath cauſed hope of things as yet to come, that daily he endevoureth the performance of them, and haſteneth the acomplishment of his whole truth.</hi> For <hi>which cometh</hi> hath this force, as a preſent future, that I may ſo ſay: For that which cometh is not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor yet altogether abſent: Therefore it is much more ſignificant, then if he had ſaid <hi>which will come,</hi> or which is about to come, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is turned: For this, <hi>which cometh,</hi> declareth that he will no fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther deferre his promiſes, but that now forthwith he is imploied in fulfilling of them: an excellent confort for them, which through wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of delay doe fainte. But thou wilt ſay, is truth attributed to the Father onely?

Wherby it commeth to paſſe, that this repairing, ſeing that it is onely unto death, ſcarſely in the ſcriptures in ioyeth the name of the reſurrection. And therefore the ſpirit ſeemeth not to ſpeake collectively, <hi>the firſt begotten of the dead,</hi> but diſtributively <hi>the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gotten from the dead,</hi> that is, of thoſe that ariſe from the dead: as before hath bene ſpoken, there being a plaine difference of the elect dead &amp; the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>

The elect are Kings by participating of Chriſts Kingdome: through which we have overcome the law, death, and ſinne, and doe daiely triumphe over the world, treading under foote the ſame by faith, 1 Ioh. 5.4.5.

                  <hi>Beholde he commeth with the cloudes.</hi> A benefite to come to be expected at his glorious coming. <hi>To come with the cloudes,</hi> is to manifeſt himſelfe with a ſtorme and tempeſt and wonderfull terrour of vehement and great ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening, to be avenged on the wicked and to deliver his. After which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Daniell alſo ſpeaketh of his coming: <hi>J ſaw in the viſions of the night, that behold one like to the ſonne of man came with the cloudes of heaven,</hi> chap. 7.13. For ſo the notable iudgements of God, ar wont to be deſcribed, by which he poureth forth his fervent wrath on his enemies, that we maie thinke that all creatures doe fight for God, alſo he will uſe the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the earth to helpe his people: and furthermore that the reprobate shall have no

After the like maner the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> being delivered out of the handes of his enemies, praiſeth God for his power shewed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in delivering of him Pſ. 18.13.14.15. In Mathew it is ſaide <hi>he will come on the cloudes,</hi> chap. 24.30. but it may be in the ſame ſence, which is in Pſ. 18.11. <hi>and he ſate on the Cherubins and did flie</hi> &amp;c. But the Angels affirme, that <hi>he will come as they had ſeene him going into heaven,</hi> Act. 1.11. And no feare was there: onely the cloude tooke him awaie out of their ſight, but without any ſtricking of terrour. But the ſimilitude ſeemeth to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the truth of the humane nature, in which he shall returne to be ſeen of all men, after which ſorte he went into heaven, not for the pompe and maieſtie of his coming: or the Angels ſpeake in regard of the Godly, to whom his coming shall be moſt ioyfull: for which the reprobate shall in vaine deſire that the mountaines should cover them.

Therefore theſe wordes of the Apoſtle are thus, as if he should ſaie, <hi>Beholde he comes with the cloudes, &amp; all men of all ſortes ſhall ſee him, alſo thoſe which perced him, to wit, the Iewes, whoſe predeceſſours crucified Chriſt, and perced his ſide with aſpeare: theſe being ſcatered every where thorough all nations, ſhall at length be convert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ſo finally this is the ſumme of all, that the benefite of Chriſt partly <hi>preſent</hi> is here celebrated in the calling of the Gentiles, (for that which he before ſpake of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſtes,</hi> is referred to the <hi>ſeaven</hi> Churches of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, that is, to all the Gentiles embracing Chriſt at that preſent, for which cauſe there is attributed to him the praiſe of glory &amp; power,) partly <hi>to come</hi> in the calling of the Iewes, which we have declared to us both by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and alſo by the deſire and wishe of all the Godly.</p>

But all theſe things are gathered in one Epiſtle and not divided in divers.

Aſthough he should ſay, truſt alway in the Lord and apply your ſelves to the holy ſtudy of thoſe thinges, with which he hath taugh that he himſelfe is to be worshiped. As long as we beſtowe our labour thus, we are converſant in the ſight of the Lord, but as ſoone as the fucalty to be at his publike worship is taken away, we are banished from his face: as Cain complaineth, being caſt out of the Church for the murther of his brother, <hi>that he was hidden from his face,</hi> Gen. 4.14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole religion of Chriſt perteining either to doctrine or to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſacraments &amp; diſcipline should shine moſt purely in theſe Churches. For the reaſon of order requireth, that in the laſt place the shining face should ſignify that the laſt of the ſeaven Churches should be famous by the cleere viſion of Chriſt. And among theſe (as we shall ſee) Philadelphia obtaineth the chiefe praiſe: the other ſo beholde the open face of Chriſt, that they may rather perceive that Chriſt is angry with them, then reioyce in any of his favorable beholding or countenance. Therefore the whole type or figure hath this ſumme: That the firſt of the ſeaven Churches is no table, by the righteouſnes of Chriſt, thorough the faith and holines of the people, and mervailous quicknes of underſtanding of the teachers, by whoſe bright eyes the darknes of errours are driven far away: that thoſe Churches in the <hi>middes</hi> are on fyre through greate affliction, yet that the truth was not altogether overwhelmed, but did make a lowde noiſe as the <hi>fall of the river Nilus</hi> although to very many, it was but as the unconſtant

                  <hi>TO the Angell:</hi> Every one of the Epiſtles are inſcribed to the <hi>Paſtours,</hi> not that they shoul have them privately to themſelves, but that they should communicate them with the reſt <hi>of the Church,</hi> as hath bin ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ch. 1.11. <hi>Sende to the ſeaven Churches which are in Aſia, to Epheſus, Smyrna &amp;c.</hi> and in the end of every one, <hi>let him heare what the ſpirit ſaith,</hi> not to the <hi>Angell</hi> alone, but <hi>to the Churches.</hi> But they are ſent to him by name, partly becauſe he is the <hi>diſpenſatour</hi> of doctrine, exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, reproofe &amp;c. even as the uſe of the Church doth require: partly becauſe the ſafety of the whole congregation, reſteth chiefly upon the integrity of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. Neither are they ſent to any one Angell, but to the whole, that I may ſo ſay, <hi>College of Paſtours,</hi> who all are comprehended in this comon word. For there was not one <hi>Angell of Epheſus,</hi> but many: neither any <hi>Prince</hi> among them, as is manifeſt from <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>to Myletum ſent for the Elders</hi> or <hi>Biſhops of Epheſus,</hi> Act. 20.17.28. He would have ſpared the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6819:24"/> multitude, if any one had bin over the reſt in authority: or at leaſt wiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of his admonitions, he would had ſpoken one word of obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience to the chiefe Bishop. But this preheminence and principalitie, was not yet bred: It began then firſt, after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were taken from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires, except that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> gave ſome shew thereof.</p>
               <p>Therefore under the name of one Angell, he writeth to the whole order of <hi>Paſtours,</hi> for whoſe praiſe, or diſpraiſe, the chiefe force of every Epiſtle is intended. For ſuch is, for the moſt parte the condition of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular congregations, as their faithfulnes and diligence shall be. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is, that at the end the admonition is given to the whole congregation, fitted to the adminiſtration of the teachers.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be thought, that theſe Epiſtles were ſent ſeverally, and aſunder one from an other, but that all were written togither in a comon Epiſtle, ſuch as we have ſaid this whole Prophecy is, &amp; that every Church fetched from thence that which belongeth to them ſeverally.

               </p>
               <p>Now the force of the name is to be declared. For it shalbe cleare in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, that the Holy Ghoſt hath choſen purpoſely thoſe Churches, which even by the very names, as it were by certen markes written on the forehead, should manifeſt their whole condition.

How is it to be feared that in this thing alſo it carieth <hi>a type of the Gentil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As touching the <hi>Antitype,</hi> ſeeing theſe ſeaven cityes containe the univer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſall condition of the Churches of the Gentiles, as it is manifeſt enough from thoſe things which have bin ſaid at the firſt chapter, in every of them not onely that one city is to be regarded, but alſo ſome felow Church is to be ioined togither with it, which may directly anſwere unto it. But of what ſorte shall we ſay that theſe <hi>antitypes</hi> are. For were theſe ſeave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches mad patternes of all Churches of that ſame time, or of a diverſe time? Yf we shall ſay the firſt, ſo as in all ages the Church ſpred through the whole world, did agree to thoſe ſeaven, to wit, that one should be an <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſine,</hi> one a <hi>Smyrnen,</hi> one a <hi>Pergamen,</hi> and ſo of the reſt, it should alwayes be of one forme, and ſuch as it was in the firſt times, ſo it shoul be at this day, againſt which the uſe of all times teacheth. Therefore it is needfull, to make every one of them ſeverally types, and in that order, in which they are numbred: but the <hi>antitypes</hi> are thoſe Churches which being divided ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the diſtance of tymes, or the ſpace of places, doe agree to every one in their order. The conveniency of the thinges will shew ſufficiently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in what boundes they may be concluded. According to this rule we doe make the firſt Chriſtian Church the <hi>Antitype</hi> of the city of <hi>Epheſus:</hi> which fetching the originall from the preaching of the Apoſtles, continued even untill Conſtantine the Great, as thoſe thinges shall make manifeſt, which shall be taught here after. This is the chiefe of all the following Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

The ſame thing teſtify <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, Origenes, Tertullian, Cypriam:</hi> But the matter is ſo cleare and manifeſt, as the contrary therto to be done at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And that thou canſt not beare the wicked:</hi> Such was the care <hi>of teaching,</hi> the maner of their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> was no leſſe pure and ſounde: Which firſt is <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſallie</hi> ſet downe, of what ſorte it was toward all the wicked: afterward <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie,</hi> what it was toward the clergie, that I may ſo ſpeake, in the next words, <hi>and haſt tried them which ſaie they are Apoſtles &amp;c.</hi> The generall diſcipline did not tolerate men in any ſorte living wickedly, and with the offenſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but according to the manner of their faulte, did rebuke either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, or before many, if private admonition profited nothing: then alſo at laſt it did debarre them from holy things, if they would not obey them that counſelled them well. And touching <hi>Epheſus</hi> it can not be uncerten, but that this holy rule did holde there, ſeeing <hi>Paul taught theire the ſpace of three yeares:</hi> who gave commaundement to <hi>Timotheus</hi> touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo diligently and exactly. The obſervation therof was famous <hi>in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church,</hi> as even <hi>Pline</hi> teſtifyeth in an Epiſtle unto <hi>Traian: The Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans are wont,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to ryſe betimes in the morning to praiſe Chriſt as God, for the preſerving of their religion, to prohibite murthers, adulteries, avarice, couſenage, and the like unto thoſe:</hi> Euſeb. kook 3. chap. 33. of the Eccleſ.

Although this <hi>loſſe of love,</hi> was nothing to the heinous offence of the widowes, For their <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> was manifeſt, his onely a faint, or rather no care, and a very great negligence of godly duties, the profeſsion of the truth being kept. But the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſpeaketh of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6819:28"/> divers tymes, as it appeareth from this that he ſaith, <hi>that thou haſt left thy firſt love,</hi> and in the verſe folowing biddeth them to <hi>doe the firſt workes.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which it is perceaved eaſily, of what ſorte was this coldnes, to it that the <hi>Angell</hi> who in the firſt times of the Goſpell receaved, faithfully executed the office of teaching, &amp; obſerved diligently every ons maners, to which forthwith he applyed a remedie by eccleſiaſticall diſcipline: afterward in the latter yeares did ſo languish, that he was negligently occupied in the firſt labour, permitted ſome of his floke to perish through ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſome through the infirmity of the flesh to be carried headlong into deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no lawfull curing undertaken.

Wherto perteineth that thriſe repeated commandement to Peter, <hi>Yf thou loveſt me, feede my ſheepe,</hi> Ioh. 16.17. But in proceſſe of time in this Church this fervency waxed colde or rather altogither vanished away, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the reprehenſion. Such is our infirmity rushing a pace no leſſe to the loſſe and deſtruction of ſpirituall life, then our bodies haſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the graves. Wherfore then is there too much cure <hi>of this,</hi> &amp; none <hi>of that?</hi> The Epheſians reteined an outward profeſsion, neither were any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities able to take it from them, as the former verſe even now taught, yet in the meane time they decayed by little and little, neglecting thoſe thinges, without which true godlines cannot conſiſt. And this leaving of love ſeemeth to have come to paſſe then, when Iohn had bin ſent away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pathmos. Doubtleſſe while he abode at Epheſus he ſuffered not either doctrine or diſcipline to decay, but being at length bereft of ſo vigilant a watchman, they fell into this deteſted drowſines. The Bishop may be for an example, although not of that city, yet of a neighbour place, who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the negligence of holy diſcipline ſuffered a certen yong man delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him of Iohn to be kept, to become a thiefe and a robber. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iohn did worthily hit and caſt in his teeth his good keeping: Euſeb. Hiſt. booke 3.23. But howſoever the hiſtory be ſilent in this matter, it is certen that the <hi>Epheſine Angels</hi> fell together into shamefull negligence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe tymes. Of which ſort alſo wee finde the careleſnes of the Church growing in uſe by little and little.</p>
               <p>In the firſt times while it had the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> for preſidents, and eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of all things, the diligence of the Elders was fervent, who did both preach the word of God faithfully, and alſo further the godlines of their flocke carefully by diſcipline, but at length after two hundred yeares fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſts birth, they ſuffered all things to waxe worſe and worſe by a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt

But Ambroſe, who rehearſeth that the divine rule was vanished quite away before his times, ſpeaking of the Elders, at length inferreth moſt clearly, <hi>Whereupon,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>both the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue and alſo afterward the Church had Elders, without whoſe counſell nothing was done in the Church: Which by what negligence it is growen out of uſe I know not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe peradventure by the ſlouthfulnes or rather pride of the teachers, while they alone will be thought to be ſomwhat:</hi> upon the 1. at Tim. chap. 5. He was not long after that time which we call the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> Yet he ſo ſpeaketh, as though ſome ages before his time, this wholeſome cuſtome had bin abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. Which thinges doe clearly shew, how in the later times the firſt love waxed cold altogether, and at length went to nothing.</p>

It was meet peradventure that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had waited for a little time, and had not urged ſo earneſtly the firſt beginnings, of which there should be no uſe in shart time. But theſe are the dreames of ſuch as are ſicke of a fever. He that knoweth what is moſt fit for his <hi>Spouſe,</hi> requireth earneſtly <hi>the firſt workes,</hi> after ſo many yeares, &amp; after the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his Church in ſo many places: he willeth that shee labour againe in the word, and that shee punish wicked men with the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pline.</hi> He knew that the order appointed by him should fit aſwell <hi>Provinces</hi> as <hi>Cities:</hi> neither should hinder any whit the civill adminiſtration, but fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther and adorne the ſame above all.

                  <hi>¶ Or elſe I will come againſt thee quickly:</hi> The threatning putteth to ſpurres, and ſtirreth up the feeble ſtrength of the remedy.

In the Greeke it is, <hi>J will come to thee,</hi> for <hi>againſt thee.</hi> Now to <hi>remove the candleſticke out of his place,</hi> is to take away the truth and dignity of the Church. Which though it be not noted expreſſely by the Hiſtoriographers, yet we may not doubt, but that according to this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6819:30"/> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Epheſꝰ loſt a while after the forme &amp; honour <hi>of a Church.</hi> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not about <hi>the name of a Church,</hi> which I know shee have retained for many ages, but for <hi>the firſt puritie,</hi> by which alone God meaſureth a holy Church, and not by coloured and naked names. Much leſſe is the <hi>candleſtick</hi> to be underſtood of <hi>the Epiſcopall dignitie,</hi> as the Ieſuite would have it, which wee reade to have continued from thoſe times eight hundred yeares at leaſt. Therefore <hi>this candleſtick</hi> was not quickly removed: Did the <hi>Angel</hi> perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture repent? It is not likely, ſeeing in the <hi>Antitype</hi> it is certen, that, that folowed in a shorte time, which is threatned here to come to paſſe. For the <hi>Angels</hi> proceeding in negligence, as we have learned from thoſe thinges which have bin before ſpoken, <hi>Chriſt tooke out of mens ſight the firſt golden candleſtick,</hi> by taking away his moſt holy ordinances, of which the world was moſt unworthy, on which <hi>the primitive Church</hi> was founded <hi>by himſelfe</hi> and <hi>by his Apoſtles.</hi> For there was a new face of things when <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> came: there remained yet the deſire of preaching in the Bishops: but the doctrine was fowlly contaminated in many points: <hi>Reliques</hi> bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be in reckoning, <hi>Temples</hi> to be adorned more magnificently, all kinde of ſuperſtition to increaſe, beſides <hi>the pride of the teachers,</hi> as a little before <hi>Ambroſe</hi> have taught, <hi>ſpoiled the Church of a neceſſarie helpe to rule their ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners.</hi> In ſtead whereof <hi>Eccleſiaſticall dignities</hi> were encreaſed, all things being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſought out, more for pompe, then for truth. And while men gave themſelves to thinges of this nature, <hi>the golden Candleſtick,</hi> which among the <hi>candleſticks</hi> did obteine worthyly the chiefe praiſe, was removed out of his place. This shall be more cleare then the light at noone day in the reſt of the booke. In the meane time let men ſee, how evill they provide for themſelves and the truth, which thinke every thing right, which they reade to have bin uſed in thoſe times. Rather let them goe to the entire age in which <hi>the candleſticke ſtoode in his place:</hi> which after it was ſet in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, the ſame was overwhelmed with darkenes, neither could he give light to others.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>But this thou haſt &amp; c:</hi> This alſo availeth to quicken their carefulnes: they might have bin proude of their preſent happines, as though their ow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne godlines had procured it to them: It is not ſo, ſaith <hi>the Spirit:</hi> but in that the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is yet witholden, it cometh not of thy approved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and diligence, but of the onely mercy of God wherby he ſpareth that little good, which thou haſt yet left. For as he would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Sodome, if ten good men had bin found in it:</hi> ſo his wrath waxeth not hotte againſt his, as long as any hope of good is remaining in them.

The <hi>Epheſine Angell</hi> therefore was pure from the contagion of this ſinne.

But after we shall ſee, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>the Nicolaitanes</hi> did extende not onely to the filthines of the body, but alſo was tranſferred unto ſpirituall fornication: ver. 15. Were they al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo without fault in this parte? In the firſt hundred yeares <hi>the Church</hi> remay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned a chaſte virgin: in the next ages it began to waxe wanton, defyling ſomewhat the mariage bed, partly with unprofitable opinions, partly with foolish ceremonies, but ſomewhat fearfully &amp; privily at the firſt: nothing according to that impudency which came together with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and afterward. In this reſpect therefore, Chriſt ſuffered it a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time, although he ſaw that their firſt love had waxed cold.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>He that hath an eare &amp;c.</hi> An Epiphonematicall concluſion, comon to all <hi>the Epiſtles:</hi> Wherein he sheweth that all whatſoever thy be ought to hearken to theſe admonitions of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Properly in deede they belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the <hi>Angels:</hi> but it concerneth us all greatly, of what ſorte their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be. They eyther offende or doe their duty not for themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition is ioined eyther with the great good or evill of the whole flocke. But what doe theſe things ſo long agoe paſt, pertaine to us? There is the ſame diſpoſition of all Churches, and of every one ſeverally: wherupon it is very profitable for us, of what age ſoever, to beware by their eville. Although all will not obey theſe admonitions, but they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whoſe <hi>eares the Spirit openeth.</hi> For they are bidden <hi>to heare, that have eares.</hi> And therefore we ought not to mervayl, if we shall ſee many to contemne ſecurely theſe threatnings, and to thinke that theſe prayſes and reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions belonge not to them at all. But what is that, which he willeth to be heard? <hi>That which foloweth by and by,</hi> ſaith the Ieſuite, <hi>To him that overcometh,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6819:31"/> J will give to eate &amp;c.</hi> Forſooth the <hi>Spirit</hi> would have the laſt clauſe to be heard of all Churches, and of all the members of any Church, but all that which was before, <hi>the Bishop</hi> shall have privatly for himſelfe: A witty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede and truſty expoſition. Are not the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> pronounced univerſally and inſcribed <hi>to the Churches,</hi> Chap. 1.11? Would it not profit them very much to be inſtructed touching the ſtate of their <hi>Angels,</hi> and to underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they might require of them by right? They are ſent indeede by name to the <hi>Angels,</hi> not that they should keepe them cloſe to themſelves as my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteryes, but that by their meanes, they might be communicated to the Churches, whom the Lord uſeth as his Ambaſſadours, to ſpeake to his ſpouſe. Which doth yet more appeare from thoſe that folow. For it doth not fit <hi>a Bishop</hi> onely which after is written to them of Smyrna, <hi>Beholde it ſhall come to paſſe that Sathan ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon &amp;c.</hi> ver. 10. or that to them of Thyatira, <hi>and to you, J ſay, and the reſt of Thyatira,</hi> ver. 24.

To the Church at Sardi chap. 3.6. at Philadelphia, ver. 13. at Laodicea ver. 22. Whereupon if the Church be reſerved to the Epiphonema, she ought to <hi>open and ſhut the eares all at one time.</hi> For there foloweth nothing to be heard.</p>

                  <hi>¶ To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life:</hi> The reward in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie one is fitted to the times: and is one and the ſame everie where, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt alone.</hi> For what greater thing can he give to his elect? Or what thing shall we need, if we doe enioy him? But according to the divers conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of times he is ſet before us in a divers manner. In this <hi>Primitive Church</hi> he is <hi>the tree of life in the middes of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> Why? Becauſe the firſt ſtate of the Spouſe, was wholy like to the firſt happines of Adam in Paradiſe: of which that was a certen viſible image and figure, reſtored in the laſt times on earth, after our ſo long banishment from thence. For there was a tree of life in the middes of the garden like a shadow: here Ieſus Chriſt borne of a Virgin was converſant with us in the middes of mortall men: there all kinde of beautyfull plantes, moſt profitable both for ſight and for meate: here a copious abondance of of all giftes, which belong either to ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to ornament: there one river, but dividing it ſelfe from the garden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fower heads: here one voice of veritie among all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but which beginning at Ieruſalem, was ſpred abroad into the foure quarters of the world, watering all landes wherſoever it floweth with peace and ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What pleaſantnes was wanting there, that the minde of man can thinke of? What is not here ſufficiently furnished by him at whoſe adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Angels</hi> themſelves are amazed? To wit, <hi>that terrible Angell, with a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

For Adam falling away from the shadowlike Paradiſe, by faith <hi>in Chriſt</hi> he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d an entrance into the true, but theſe heretikes being driven from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and true, what returne can ever be hoped for? Seeing therefore that this is the naturall ſenſe of the wordes, how foully doe they erre, who do count <hi>the Primitive Church</hi> an infant, rude and imperfect? and doe attribute ripeneſſe of age and perfection to the latter corrupt times? For they doe preferre <hi>Tophet</hi> before <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> neither doe minde that all pleaſantnes did belong to the firſt beginning: but thornes and thiſles and all noiſome her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bes to the curſe following. Farre be it that we should thinke the water flowing by durty channels, either purer or ſweeter or fitter for our uſe, the further it shall be diſtant from the fountaine. Further let the reprobate know that they doe never eate of this tree. For there is the ſame meate both for way and for country: There is onely a difference of a more full fruition, wherin we shall reioice after the battaile finished. Neither is the reward of them that overcome given to the ſlougthfull cowards. The An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gell will keepe them farre from it with his gliſtering ſword, that they may not plucke any thing at any time from this tree.</p>

In which wordes we have shewed <hi>that Chriſt</hi> is prayſed as the maker and ruler of all thinges: by whoſe authority and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alone all things are done, and that to his glory: or rather that in this elogie is praiſed the mervay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ioining together as well of his great <hi>maieſty</hi> as of his <hi>humility.</hi> Which interpretation receaveth confirmation from hence, that the condition of the <hi>Smyrneans</hi> was like; <hi>Thou art afflicted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and poore, but in very deede thou art riche.</hi> What other thing is this then, although with the world thou art counted <hi>the laſt,</hi> thou art notwithſtanding in truth <hi>the firſt.</hi> And toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo it sheweth that alteration, wherby the truth firſt flourished amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the <hi>Smyrneans</hi> in very great eſtimation, afterward deſpiſed &amp; trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote of hypocrits: even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the beginning was in incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible glory, <hi>God with God,</hi> but in the laſt times, <hi>taking upon him the forme of a ſervaunt, made himſelfe of no reputation, being made like unto men.</hi> He taketh to him ſelfe titles that may fit the preſent condition of thinges. Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he ſpreadeth a divers beame of his glory in the ſeverall Epiſtles, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the diverſe condition wherein the Churches are. Wherby he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that, that of his infinite divine maieſty is chiefly to be contemplated with the minde, which may be moſt availeable for the preſent matter. But that they should not thinke that they muſt alway ly in this baſe eſtate, he adioineth another title: <hi>Who was,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>dead, but is alive;</hi> as though he should ſay; although I was in the beginning <hi>the firſt,</hi> after <hi>the laſt,</hi> yet I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not any long time in this moſt baſe eſtate, but death being overcom within the ſpace of three dayes, I obteined my former dignity, in which I now live for ever. Theſe thinges then declare the notable cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge that came to paſſe at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and no leſſe in his <hi>Antitype.</hi> Where the firſt truth, which by the ſpace of three hundred yeares was eſtablished by ſo much blood, be came at length to be hated of the Chriſtians themſelves, and the laſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:6819:33"/> ſtayed together with his profeſſours: which Chriſt, as he himſelfe roſe from the dead, should raiſe againe from the duſt, and place it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer degree of dignity. Why then should they be diſcouraged, whom their Captaine hath gone before in the ſame ſteppes? Or wherfore should they feare afflictions, whoſe iſſue is ſo ioifull and confortable?</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>J knowe thy workes and affliction:</hi> The narration of the condition, which he ſaith, <hi>is knowen of him,</hi> as in the reſt, leaſt peradventure they should ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that their miſeries are not regarded of him, becauſe of his ſo long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferrance. The ſtate of this Church was afflicted, as at the preſent time in this verſe, ſo afterward to be expected, in the next: Wherto the <hi>Antitype</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth altogether. For after the firſt age driven away, by and by a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſtrife aroſe, when Conſtantine ſucceeded. The perſecutions of open enemies ceaſed, but the ſtrifes and contentions of the citizens forthwith waxed very hote. And not onely of the whole Church in generall, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of this city: <hi>Theodoſius Iunior</hi> boyling with envie againſt one Cyrus, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw to be very gratious with the people, ſendeth to <hi>Smyrna</hi> under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to make him Bishop of this city, but with a determinate purpoſe that he should be killed; For the Smyrneans had killed long a goe 4 of their Bishops; which barbarous cruelty sheweth howe grievouſly this Angell was afflicted: <hi>Epitome</hi> chr. ſet out with Euſeb. chr. by the famous Ioſeph Scaliger, pag. 293. But if we shall enlarge this <hi>Smyrna</hi> a little unto thoſe contentions of the citiezens, of which I ſpake; by and by came Arius, who kindled that fire, wherby all thinges as well divine as humane, were enfla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Bishops ſtudied noe other thing, then that one might ſpoile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of their ſeates and dignities. <hi>Euſtatius Antiochus</hi> was banished with a great company of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Deacons:</hi> Athan. in his Epiſtle to them that lead a ſolitary life. Athanaſius him ſelfe the onely defender almoſt of the truth, was not onely aſſailed, but alſo oppreſſed with all kinde of falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations; neither did they ceaſe from their wicked aſſalting him, before that he was banished to <hi>Treveres</hi> in France. Thoſe were ſorowfull times, when the Emperour in the meane time not minding ſufficiently the drifts of the Bishops, did not knowe the true originall of thoſe ſturres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And thy poverty:</hi> That is, houw thou art moked and contemned, as a beggar: but be thou deſpiſed mor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any <hi>Jrus</hi> of thoſe hypocrits, thou art rich in mine account, that thou maieſt regard the leſſe the wicked ſcoffing of thoſe men. And that we may let paſſe the <hi>Smyrneans,</hi> the matter is cleare in the <hi>Antitype.</hi> How few were there of the Orthodoxe that durſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the truth? How ſuperſtitiouſly were thoſe fewe ſuppreſſed of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes? Certenly the Saints were conſtrained to runne hither and thither,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6819:33"/> that they might crave aide againſt the tyranny. They alſo being turned out of their goods, could not maitaine their life but by the liberality of others. Athanaſius alone may be in ſtead of many exemples: from whoſe often pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rils, flight, hidden places, no hope to eſcape, any may eaſily ſee, how the faithfull could prevaile nothing with their riches to repell the iniuries of their enemyes. The Smyrnean Angell was then <hi>poore</hi> in deede, if we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure riches by humane defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ But thou art rich:</hi> Not naked and forſaken, as men thinke, but by mee and in my account abounding in all riches: Which things alſo are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for to shew what defence and eſtimation Chriſt could prepare for his even in ſpite of the world. Authority did increaſe together with afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we knowe it came to paſſe concerning Athanaſius, who being vexed with all maner of contumelies in the Eaſt, was in the weſt in great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the ſonne, <hi>Conſtans</hi> the brother, <hi>Iulius</hi> Roman, The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>of Treveres,</hi> who gave him entertainement moſt kindly and liberally the ſpace of two yeares, did reverence him according as he was wortthy. Moreover alſo <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the great himſelfe having perceaved the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his adverſaries, did honore his innocency and vertu, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring him againe from banishement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the blaſphemy of thoſe &amp;c.</hi> Hitherto the kinde of the preſent cala<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mity: now he sheweth the authors, arrogating to themſelves, that which in no wiſe was fitting them. But is it blaſphemy for a Iew, to profeſſe him ſelfe to be a Iewe? A <hi>Jew</hi> is taken figuratively for one people of God, which alone among all men, knew the right way of worshipping him; as though he should ſay: They that boaſt that they worship God after the ancient rule of the law, in which maner their anceſtors once worshipped, and all men ought allwaies to worship. This was blaſphemy, the retaining of the worship abolished, and the thruſting upon God the ancient ceremonies, by which the glory of his ſonne ſent at length into the world, shoud be overwhelmed: For which cauſe, although they were <hi>Iewes</hi> by ſtocke, they lyed in affirming that they were <hi>Jewes,</hi> being ſo farre from that holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that in very truth they made a <hi>Synagogue of Sathan.</hi> And it is knowne, with what bitter mindes they perſecuted Chriſtians in all places, as we ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>Antioche, Piſidia, Jconium, Lyſtra,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Act. 13.50. and 14.2.5.19. Which they did alſo at <hi>Smyrna</hi> about theſe times, as we learne from this place. Vnder <hi>Conſtantin</hi> theſe Iewes wer <hi>Arian Bishops,</hi> namely, <hi>Euſebius Nicodemienſis, Theognis of Chalcedon, Maris, Patrophilus, Vrſatius, Valens,</hi> and the reſt of this ſorte, men in deede not Eth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nikes, nor woly void of all knowledge of God, as neither were the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:6819:34"/> but bearing the name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> &amp; ſuch as were ſtandart bearers in this warre. Who notwithſtanding did holde their errors with thooth &amp; naile, no leſſe then that ſtubburne nation of the Iewes, ſtriving to eſtablish their Decrees onely, to vexe by all meanes ſuch as were contrary minded, to boaſt that they alone had the true faith, to condemne all the reſt of ungod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lines and blaſphemy. But whatſoever boaſtings that wicked company made, as though God dwelt in their congregations onely, they gathered Churches not <hi>to God,</hi> but to <hi>the Devill,</hi> of whoſe Synagogue, they were the chiefe rulers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Feare none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer:</hi> Now he inſtructeth them againſt the future evills, which were apparent to be more grievous then thoſe that were paſt. Thoſe thinges with which the <hi>Iewes</hi> did trouble them at the preſent, then alſo thoſe falſe accuſations of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> while <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> lived, were light skirmishes of a sharper battaile following by and by after. Therefore he deſcribeth diligently all the manner of this combate, <hi>who ſhould be the chiefe Captaine of it, with what kinde of cruelty he ſhould rage, to what ende, and how long.</hi> The Prince is the <hi>Devill,</hi> whom after we shall learne to denote the <hi>Heathen Emperours,</hi> open enemies of the truth, as chap. 12.9. This doth comprehende alſo the <hi>Heretiques,</hi> Chriſtians in name, but in very truth wolves devouring the flocke.</p>
               <p>The kinde of punishement is the <hi>priſon,</hi> under which, as the hiſtory tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth is comprehended proſcriptions, confiſcation of goods, banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſlaughters, fires, tortures. With all theſe thinges the <hi>Devill</hi> should great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torment, to drawe men from the truth. But this perſecution should <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ten daies</hi> onely. And a <hi>day</hi> in this booke is taken for a yeare. The nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber alſo of ten ſome time ſignifieth properly, ſome time by Synecdoche noteth out ſome uncerten number: I thinke that both are here uſed, that <hi>certen number</hi> should be of the <hi>Type,</hi> and uncerten of the <hi>Antitype.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore as touching <hi>Smyrna</hi> it ſelfe, this perſecution fell out in the times of <hi>TRAIAN,</hi> which <hi>Devill,</hi> a profeſſed enemy of the truth, did reigne next after this writing, very fierce againſt Chriſtians, delivering men into priſon and death, that he might make them to renounce the profeſsion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Smyrna</hi> could not be free from the comon calamity: eſpecially when <hi>Bythynia</hi> being nigh to it, did altogether abounde with the murders of the Chriſtians, as the Epiſtle of <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> to Traian doeth shew. From whence alſo it may be gathered after a ſorte, of what continuance the perſecution was. For in the fourteenth yeare of <hi>Traian, Plinie</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him the multitude of thoſe that were ſlaine, was an occaſion of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6819:34"/> ſtaying that rage, and of obtayning ſome breathing. What yeare it began, it is not plainly ſet downe by the Hiſtory-writers. Some ſuppoſe that it was at the very beginning of his reigne: but in the fourth yeare trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over the <hi>Daces</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> he ſeemeth to have had firſt his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hindred, ſo as he could not have leaſure to afflict the Chriſtians. But it is certen that he exerciſed his cruelty <hi>ten yeares</hi> at leaſt. It is likely that the end of that warre gave the beginning of tormenting <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it needfull that this affliction be referred to <hi>Smyrna</hi> onely: but that it was that generall of which he maketh mention in the <hi>Church of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, which ſhould come upon the whole world,</hi> Chap. 3.10. As touching the <hi>Antitype, Conſtance and Valence Emperours,</hi> in name Chriſtians; in deede noe leſſe fierce againſt the orthodoxe and true godly people, then once the <hi>Ethnike Devills</hi> were. In which account alſo are holden the inferiour mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of that wickednes: of the <hi>people, Syrianus,</hi> a Captaine, and <hi>Sebaſtianus,</hi> Governour of the armies <hi>Manicheus;</hi> Of the <hi>Biſhops Euſebius,</hi> once of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedia, then of <hi>Conſtantinople, Macedonius, Georgius Alexandrinus,</hi> and others of that ſorte, not <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but monſters: whoſe barbarous cruelty was ſcarce matched by any <hi>Tyrant.</hi> Of old the matter was handled with brawles, chidings, and calumnies of all ſortes: But after the death of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> the <hi>Devill</hi> was to come forth on the ſtage, and what broiles were raiſed up? It was a light thing to drive holy men into banishement, to caſt very many into priſon, to kill almoſt an infinite number; They tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed with torments and all manner of contumelious punishments. Some were beaten with ſtripes unto death, ſome marked in the forehead with prints of hotte iron, ſome tormented with other tortures. Yea the breſtes were cut of from holy women: Vnto ſome they were burnt of with a hotte iron: to many with egges roſted in the fire to an exceeding great heat. Who would beleeve that any ſuch thing could have bin inferred upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, from men of Chriſtian profeſsion? It cannot be shewed in fewe wordes, how full of calamity thoſe times were, but ſee Socrat. book 2. and 4. Theod. book 2. and 4. Sozom. book 3. 4. 6.</p>
               <p>And although this tyranny did continue above fourteene yeares, yet notwithſtanding it doth make thoſe ten daies of the ſame manner that we have ſayd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Be faithfull unto the death:</hi> He provoqueth unto fortitude, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being propounded to be <hi>Eternall life.</hi> It is a profitable loſſe which is recompenſed with ſo great gaine. What should nor the godly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe moſt willingly, being ſure of ſuch a reward? It is fitted to the times miniſtring comfort againſt the loſſe of this preſent life.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:6819:35"/>
               <p>To which purpoſe he ſpake before, <hi>that he was alive which had bin dead,</hi> that by his exemple they should learne not to feare death, which they should know to be a meane between God and them of eternall happines.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>He that hath an eare:</hi> The wonted concluſion, warning all men, to hearken diligently to theſe inſtructions touching fortitude and courage of minde in afflictions. We were inſtructed before againſt the ſluggishnes which is inbread in us: here we are armed againſt outward violence. The reward which is added to the end, <hi>He that overcometh ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death,</hi> is common to the whole Church. That which was before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed properly to the <hi>Angell,</hi> the knowledge whereof notwithſtanding was very neceſſary to the people, as hath bin ſaid before. But ſeeing that this conflict was to be undergone as well of the people as of the <hi>Paſtours,</hi> confort alſo is given them by name, to the ſame purpoſe that the former was, but in a divers reſpect. For there are two things which are wont to kindle the deſire unto every excellent acte, <hi>hope of reward</hi> and <hi>contemning of the perill:</hi> that firſt was propoſed to <hi>the Poſtours,</hi> whoſe courage is wont to be more ready and valiant by looking into the reward. This ſecond to the <hi>People,</hi> whom the feare of danger chiefly withdraweth from their duty, &amp; ſuffereth them not to undertake any thing worthy commendation. He teacheth therefore that they muſt not feare to ſpend their life, if need be, for the truth ſake: for there shall be no feare of the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> by which the body and ſoule perish for ever: according to that of <hi>Chriſt: Feare not them that kill the body, but cannot kill the ſoule: but feare him rather, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoule and body in hell fyre,</hi> Mat. 10.28. This <hi>in hell fyre,</hi> is this ſame which he calleth <hi>ſecond death:</hi> By the which the whole man shalbe no leſſe deprived of all ſolace in God, as the body is deſtitute of all helpe being ſeparated from the ſoule by the firſt death. This is that horrible <hi>death,</hi> to be feared in deede, from which he that hath <hi>overcome death,</hi> doe deliver his: from which he promiſed <hi>to free them that overcome:</hi> He doth not promiſe to deliver them from the <hi>firſt,</hi> being too light a thing, either to be given by ſuch a great price Rewarder, or to be expected by thoſe that ar his. And what need is there to be defended from the <hi>firſt death,</hi> which the neceſsity of nature will bring at length; but to prevent it for the truths ſake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth a farre greater crowne? He promiſeth therfore that which is beſt, and doth not allure us with a vaine shew of ſome light thing.</p>

It was therefore a great thing to profeſſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the hearing &amp; ſight of ſo mighty a city &amp; ſpiteful againſt the truth. <hi>There may not be prophecying in Bethel, for it is the ſanctuary of the king and the Kings houſe,</hi> Amos 7.13. <hi>Aretas</hi> reporteth of <hi>Antipas, that he gave teſtimony to the truth at Pergamus, and that his martyrdome was kept even to his times:</hi> But I finde noe more in any author worthy credit. From this place it is evident that he was a very famous <hi>Martyr,</hi> by whoſe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings was ſignified the rage of a moſt grievous perſecution. This is another praiſe that <hi>Pergamus</hi> had continued conſtantly in the faith, when a fierce tempeſt raged very greatly.</p>
               <p>It is an eaſy thing to profeſſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when a man may doe it either with honour, or without danger: But to reteine the profeſsion of him without feare, even with the danger of life, is an excellent commendation and a point of true courage. Wee have ſaid that the <hi>Antitype</hi> was the Church from the foure hundreth yeare, to the three hundreth above the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth; When after <hi>Conſtantius, Iulianus</hi> and <hi>Valence, Smyrna</hi> being left it went further toward the North unto <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that is, was hidden in thicke darknes, being brought under the power of that City, where <hi>The Throne of Satan is,</hi> namely <hi>ROME.</hi>

                  </hi> was reſerved to this place, to wit, that he might ſignify his true afſpring, <hi>the Pope of Rome,</hi> as like his father, as one egge an other. He in theſe times which we have ſpoken of should treade the Church under feete. But this was the ſinne of the <hi>Pergamen Angell,</hi> that he ſuffered too favourably men to draw of the dregges of this falſe Prophet. It was his duty to have bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

But how then had he but a few thinges againſt the <hi>Angell,</hi> ſeeing the whole ſtate of the Church was ſo greatly corrupt? Wonderfull is the gentle entreating of our <hi>God.</hi> He requireth but a few thinges of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom he giveth fewe.

                  <hi>¶ That they ſhould eate of thoſe thinges which were ſacrificed to Idols;</hi> that is, being preſent at the worship of Idols, should give honour to them.

But the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſeemeth with good adviſement to have ſpoken rather of eating that which is offered to Idols, then of worshipping the Idoll, that he might shewe the crafty and ſubtill way of this Balaam in provoking and alluring men to Idolatry. It ſeemeth not ſo ungodly a thing to men <hi>to eate fleſh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficed to Idols,</hi> as to fall downe at the feete and give adoration to the Image.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:6819:39"/> For becauſe thoſe few and rare faithfull, in ſo great a multitude of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, were hated of all, condemned of ſchiſme, errour, hereſy, and I know not what wickednes, an abſolving ſtone is promiſed them.

A name well concurring with the thing. For the godlines of this Church is growing, as a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter new borne, which alway groweth up, till shee hath attained to a full maturity. In which reſpect it is oppoſed to <hi>Epheſus:</hi> which being of full age the very firſt day, or shortly after, the further shee proceedeth, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to old age, became weaker every day, while at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the naturall heat being extinguished, shee fell into the coldnes of death. And here is the firſt bending from the <hi>North,</hi> to wit, <hi>Pergamus,</hi> toward the ſouth, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> being diſtant, according to Ptolemy, about foure ſcore English miles. The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the time from the yeare 1300. unto 1520.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Theſe things ſaith the ſonne of God:</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh himſelfe knowne by his <hi>name, eyes,</hi> &amp; <hi>feete:</hi> every one of which doe appeare more clearly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Antitype</hi> of what ſorte they are. As touching the <hi>name,</hi> now firſt of all it offereth it ſelfe, not expreſſed before eyther in the things ſeen or heard in the firſt chapter. There was mention of <hi>the ſonne of man,</hi> ver. 13. but the whole viſion did declare ſufficiently that he was <hi>the ſonne of God.</hi> It ſeemeth here to be uſed, as though now he would returne out of Egypt. He had bin exiled now a good while, but in the renewing of the Church he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as it were home, beginning more familiarly to be knowne to his, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom he had ſeemed before time to be farr of. The <hi>firie eyes,</hi> are thoſe ſpoken of in the firſt chapter fourteen and fifteen verſes: by whoſe cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he sheweth to the <hi>Thyatirens,</hi> that now the time flourisheth wherein the light of the truth should diſpell darknes of errours and falshood, as it flyeth at the ſight of the fyre: as came to paſſe about the yeare 1300. when a new company of Teachers aroſe, by the iudgement of all which the <hi>Pope</hi> was ſtrangled, and began to be ſpoiled of his eſtimation, which he had kept nowe a good while by fraude. For they did maintayne ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that <hi>the Imperiall Maieſty</hi> ought to be prefered above other, and that the Pope had noe power over it. Among theſe were <hi>Ockamus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius, Patavinus, Dantes, Iohn de Ganduno,</hi> and many other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The feete like fine Braſſe</hi> doe teach, with what kinde of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>the Romane Balaam</hi> should rage againſt the faithfull feet of Chriſt, he should deliver them to be burned in the flame, endevouring to quench one burning by another.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6819:40"/> Which cruelty he hath not exerciſed now the firſt time, but hath brought it to noble infamy, by more frequent burnings then ever before. The fires ſhyned through all <hi>Europe</hi> many Martyrs burnt every day. But notable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others were <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierome of Prage, who a noble payre of feet like fine Braſſe did ſhyne in the fornace of Conſtancie in the eyes of all our world.</hi> But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> was deceaved who thought to have conſumed thoſe feete by fire. For now at length he hath had experience, that theſe feete are not ſtubble, but fine Braſſe, which shineth more in the fyre, and is not conſumed.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>I know thy workes:</hi> The workes which are rehearſed, <hi>Charitie, Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>Patience</hi> perteine to private duty, rather then publike office: aſthough this <hi>Church</hi> were hid in ſome ſecret members, and was not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in an excellent adminiſtration of thinges. Such was doubtleſſe the ſtate of the <hi>Thyatirian City:</hi> It is plaine touching the <hi>Antitype.</hi> For although there were every where many excellent men, who did defend the trueth by writings and lively voice, yet no publike Churches companies were conſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuted or ſet in order. Or if any were, as about the end of this periode men began to meet together ſomewhat boldly, they obteined not a lawfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>The chiefe prayſe was of their <hi>Love</hi> one to another, but not that feigned, wherby men promiſe largely, but performe nothing, but wherby both by deed and worke they holpe where there was need: whereupon un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to charity he adioineth miniſtration.

               <p>The laſt prayſe is of <hi>their laſt Workes, which are moe then the former.</hi> For ſo doth reade the <hi>Comon tranſlation, the Complutent Edition, and the Kings Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who is alſo uſed by Robart Stevens, in his Edition</hi> thus, <hi>And thy laſt workes moe then the firſt,</hi> to wit, by putting out the ſecond <hi>and.</hi>

               <p>And ſo indeede the ſentence runneth better; eſpecially ſeeing <hi>workes</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed in the beginning of the verſe: which if they were ſet downe againe, and not read togither, peradventute the repetition should be ſuperfluous. As touching the matter, it is an excellent prayſe to growe in godlines, and to exceed the former times in the fruitfulnes of good workes: which thing indeede befalleth them that are planted in the houſe of the Lord, <hi>which in old age are fatte and green,</hi> Pſal. 92.15. <hi>Whoſe way ſhineth as the light, it ſhaineth more and more to the perfect day,</hi> Proverb. 4.18. So this Church alway encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and proceeding further and further, grew ſtronger every day fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſmall beginnings. About the yeare 1300, many ſtronge couragious men ſprung up, faithfull deffendours of the truth, but about ſeventy yeares after, <hi>Iohn Wicklefe</hi> added much to their beginnings: hee made cleare the doctrine in farre moe pointes, and confirmed that more plentifully with arguments, which they had barely ſearched out. And fouty yeares after followed him <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierome of Prage:</hi> by whoſe preaching and martyrdome there was made a farre greater encreaſing. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> followed theſe, who openly did fall away from the <hi>Romane Antichriſt,</hi> and appointed a more re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed worship in their aſſemblyes. And then the myndes of all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly became ſtouter through all <hi>Europe,</hi> who more bouldly profeſſed the truth, howſoever they knew, that they did it with the danger of their life. Neither did <hi>Thyatira</hi> ſtande ſtill here, but about the yeare one thouſand five hundreth, ſhee powred out largely a new plenty of moſt learned men: who gave noe vaine hope of a fuller and clearer light to breake forth by &amp; by after. And <hi>theſe are the laſt workes more then the firſt.</hi> Worthily therfore ſhe is <hi>Thugateira</hi> that is, a <hi>daughter</hi> growing ſo notably, even as <hi>the waters running from the Temple, which at the firſt being ſmall, after full of ſhallow places, could not at the laſt be paſſed over for the deepnes,</hi> Ezech. 47. And ſo in this firſt bending from the North, was made the <hi>firſt payre of contraries;</hi> For this <hi>growing Thyatira</hi> is directly oppoſite to <hi>Languiſhing Epheſus,</hi> which became <hi>omiſſion,</hi> leaving, as we have ſhewed, worſer in the laſt times, by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall omiſsion of labour and watchfulnes, then alſo heaping up ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till at length all care of true godlines awas abated, and ſo in the two following Churches it became alway worſer: Now at laſt it began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and to oppoſe three other Churches to theſe three, as we ſhall ſee in ech one of them.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>But I have a fewe things againſt thee:</hi> The reprehenſion is, that <hi>the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſabell was permitted to deceave the ſervants of God with her vaine ſhewes,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either their <hi>neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> or <hi>faint heart,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> are blamed; wherby it came to paſſe, that ſhee dealt not with the wicked according to their deſerts;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6819:41"/> but they were ſuffered to ſleepe ſecurely in their ſinnes. Who this <hi>Iezabell</hi> was in the <hi>Thyatiren City,</hi> the old Hyſtory sheweth not. From this place we underſtand, that in the ſame place there was a certen <hi>Chiefe</hi> and famous woman, an Idolatrice, Sorcereſſe &amp; Harlot, like the ancient <hi>Iezabell,</hi> which was <hi>the wife of Ahab;</hi> yet by thus much more furnished to deſtroy, becauſe this shewed her ſelfe openly an enemy and adverſary to the truth: that would be accounted for a <hi>Prophetiſſe.</hi> From that which followeth, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that shee was taught to the naughtines in the ſchoole of the <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> of which shee became a ſchoole miſtres, teaching others the ſame ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. For the Heretiques abuſed the labour of women to ſparſe abroad their poyſons. <hi>Simon Magus hath his Helena, Carpocrates his Marcellinam, Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les his Philumenam, Montanus</hi> after in the latter times, in places nigh to this <hi>Thyatira,</hi> his <hi>Priſcilla</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximilla.</hi> In the <hi>Antitype</hi> the thing is clearer. For this <hi>Iezabell</hi> is <hi>Rome Queene, Idolatrice, Sorcereſſe, Whore, Killer of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Prophetiſſe, the head of all Churches, and the whole way of ſalvation, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yeelded to any hereſyes,</hi> and many ſuch like, with which wee shall ſee her adorned by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> partly in this book, partly shee boaſtingly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth her ſelfe impudently. Lately we learned tha the <hi>Pope</hi> was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Balaam,</hi> now we have the city shewed by <hi>Iezabell.</hi> Both which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine to the deſcribing of the ſame <hi>Synagogue of Sathan,</hi> ſee in the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>City,</hi> are things very neerly conioyned. And how doth it fit the times, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth ſet before our eyes now ſuch a <hi>city?</hi> How long time did the <hi>Pope</hi> deceive under a shew of godlines, as the <hi>Hypocriticall Balaam</hi> in the former ages about the beginning of increaſing honour and reputation? but after he was growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an inmeaſurable greatnes, lifted up above <hi>Kings</hi> &amp; <hi>Emperours,</hi> ſo as now all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quaked at the very name of the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> his <hi>Rome</hi> became <hi>the Queene Iezabell, an impudent and painted whore. Balaam</hi> therefore and <hi>Iezabell</hi> declare the ſame kinde of impiety: onely they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguished by the increaſe an times. <hi>Rome</hi> in her infancy, as <hi>Balaam,</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled her matters more warily and ſecretly: shee pretended that shee could not ſpeake, but that which the <hi>LORD</hi> should put in her mouth: being grown to <hi>full age,</hi> as the <hi>Prophetiſſe Iezabell</hi> preacheth openly that <hi>ſhee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre,</hi> and that <hi>ſhee is the rule of faith and all godlines; That</hi> abuſed the labour of Kings to bring in and ſet up Idolatry: <hi>This</hi> by her owne authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to committe fornication and to eate thinges ſacrificed to <hi>Idols,</hi> in exacting the worshipping of Idols &amp; Images. Who can admire enough the ſingular art of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> who hath ſo lively ſet forth this matter.

                  </note> Sardis is the ſeconde of the Churches riſing againe, going yet further in the South, and growing in a more ample light of trueth. The <hi>Antitype</hi> is <hi>the firſt reformed Churche,</hi> begun of God by <hi>Martin Luther of Wittemberg,</hi> a towne of Saxe upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Albe, in the yeare 1517, when that holy man oppoſed himſelfe againſt the <hi>Romane Queſtors</hi> ſelling for mony the forgivenes of ſinnes to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The trueth began to be revived under the <hi>Thyatiren ſtate,</hi> but noe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation followed; This was firſt undertaken at the time which I have ſaid. For which cauſe wee shall finde no mention in theſe three <hi>Churches</hi> of this Chapter, eyther of <hi>Balaam</hi> or <hi>Jezabell.</hi> For they were pure from the fault of this whore, whoſe fellowship they renounced utterly. But yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſeeing the ſame should not be done of all after the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but a threefolde difference would be found in them, in like maner they are shadowed out by three cityes according to the beginning and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every one. The firſt, after the impudency of <hi>Iezabell</hi> reſtreined, is <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> And the firſt after the <hi>Romane impudency</hi> weakened, is the <hi>Germane Church</hi> of that time, which even nowe I have ſet downe. Onely the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and good readers are to be intreated that they doe not thinke me to deſcende to this or that interpretation by any ill will, but in good faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to follow that ſenſe, which the printed ſteppes of the <hi>Spirit</hi> going before, ſeeme to me not darkely to point at. I know how fearfull a thing it is even to hurt the eſtimation of any brother with wrongfull ſuſpicions, how much more heynous a ſinne it should be to caſt any blot rashly upon any whole Church? And certenly as in all my life I deſire to put farr away all virulency of tongue, ſo eſpecially I have thought alway that I muſt take heede that I make not the name of God a cloak for my luſt. Let not then the office of an Interpreter be any fraude to mee, ſpeaking either here or in other places of things preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t otherwiſe peradve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many either would or expect. It is an impious and deteſtable thing, to <hi>play the hucksters
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6819:47"/> with the word of God,</hi> in ſpeaking rather according to the pleaſure of men, then the trueth of the thing it ſelfe. Therefore all as well hatred as favour ſet aſide, if wee shall ſee that that which is uttered agreeth with the trueth, let us quake rather at the threatnings of the moſt iuſt God, then be angry with him, who to the end that wee may not be oppreſſed unwares with the evils hanging over our heades, hath endevoured to his utmoſt power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the hidden truth. Which I hope I shall obtayne eaſily of all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo farr shall it be from them, to reprehend myne induſtry: with which hope ſupported, I will proceed to my purpoſe through Gods helpe.</p>

They are fetched from the comon inſcription of the Epiſtle in the 1 chap. ver. 4. They are <hi>ſeaven</hi> for the abondance of all gifts, which that number uſually ſignifyeth. Chriſt hath in his owne power, that being the keeper of the ſtorehouſe of the heavenly grace, he beſtoweth the Spirit on whom he shal thinke good; Wherupon he ſaith, that <hi>he will ſende the Conforter from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Iohn, 15.26. <hi>who ſhould receive from Chriſt, and ſhew unto us,</hi> Io. 16.14. The <hi>Starres</hi> are in the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, chap. 1.16. Likewiſe in the <hi>Epheſine Church,</hi> wherein we have heard is declared the ſafety of the miniſters, whom Chriſt carrieth in his handes, chap 2.1. To what end then is this repeated a fresh? Was there wanting now any other honour ſpent wholy on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? in no wiſe, but onely becauſe the conveniency of things, and not any vayne novelty, is ſought. Becauſe <hi>Sardis</hi> should finde the ſame ſafegarde of Chriſt in defending her Paſtors, which he had shewed in Epheſus; not without cauſe doth he uſe the ſame ſimilitude, wherein there is ſo great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iunction of things. But of <hi>Sardis</hi> the Hiſtory ſpeaketh not a word: Which thing in her <hi>Antitype</hi> is moſt cleare. For he that giveth the <hi>Spirit</hi> plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to whom and when he will, shed out in thoſe times ſo great plenty of all giftes, as no where els in theſe laſt times. Good learning had bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as buryed, being driven away for many ages by the ruſticity of the <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laſtiques:</hi> untill at length, after the wonderfull art of printing was found out (which cunning flowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame fountaine of the Spirit) many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wits were rayſed up to ſearch out the truth. Among which were, <hi>Iohn Picus, Mirandulanus, Angelus Politianus, Platina, Trapezuntius, Gaza, Hermolaus Barbarus, Marſilius Ficinus, Pyrbachius, Ioannes de monte Regio, Aldus Manutius, Rodolphus Agricola, Ioannes Iovianus, Pontanus, Philippus Beroaldus, Ioannes Reuchlinus,</hi> and many other moſt learned men; Whoſe chiefe labour was in ſetting forth the tongues, arts, and other humane learning:

                  </gap>, the conioyned times have taught. For by and by after came <hi>Martin Luther, Philippe Melanthon, Eraſme of Roterodam, Zuinglius, Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius, Capito, Blaurerus, Bucer, Muſculus, Calvin,</hi> and many other moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned men, ſo many lights of the Chriſtian world, who being holpen by the ſtudyes of thoſe former, brought forth againe the trueth, covered with long filthines and uncleannes, diſsipated the Romish darknes, and diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led utterly as ſmoke hither and thither all the ſubtilities of the enemies. Doth not Chriſt worthily take upon him ſelfe this enſigne of the <hi>ſeaven ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> enriching this time with ſo great plenty of gifts? Neither was leſſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous his power &amp; grace in conſerving ſafety to the Paſtors. Who would not have thought that <hi>Luther</hi> in ſo great hatred and envy of all men, for whom almoſt the whole world layed waite, even alſo he under whoſe feete the <hi>Emperours</hi> once were compelled to ſubiect their neckes, that Luther I ſay, should have dyed a thouſand deathes? But peradventure troubles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed up he did ſcarce endure; yes by the ſpace almoſt of thirty yeeres he abode in the battell ſafe, even from privy aſſaults, with which the <hi>Pope</hi> is wont to make away thoſe men, whom he cannot conquer with open warr and force: and at length lying ſicke in his bed and giving up his ſoule to him that gave it, he ſlept quietly in Chriſt. What should I ſpeake of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthon, Peter Martyr, John Calvin</hi> and the reſt of the valiant Herolts? <hi>Bucer</hi> being buried a fewe yeares before, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth turned to duſt, was digged out of his grave, or rather an other buried there latelyer, that they might ſhew their cruelty even in the burning of his aſhes, whom they could not, nor durſt not hurt, while he lived. Who then hath not ſeene <hi>the ſtarres in the right hand of Chriſt,</hi> ſo wonderfully defending his ſervants againſt all force of adverſaries? And ought not the fresh memory of theſe things, to give conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy and courage unto all, that repoſing themſelves in the ſame protection, they may goe boldly to the deffenſe of the truth every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his calling?

But in what thing conſiſted this fayning, as farre as concerneth the city <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dis,</hi> it is not cleare to us from the hiſtory: there flourished in the ſame pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce not very long after, the famous <hi>Melito,</hi> celebrated by Euſeb in his 4. booke chap. 26. But hence it appeareth that the matter was brought to that caſe when Ihon wrote, that although the <hi>Angell</hi> ſeemed to himſelfe, and peradve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to ſome others, excellently well furnished with all things unto ſalvation; yet that he wanted many things neceſſary, and abounded in the contrary. Wee knowe that they which are <hi>alive outwardly,</hi> may <hi>be dead</hi> either in <hi>ignorance of doctrine and corruption,</hi> or through <hi>careleſnes of Godly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes:</hi> as Chriſt calleth them dead, which were voide of faith and knowledg of ſalvation, Iohn 5.25. And the Apoſtle calleth the wanton widow, <hi>dead when ſhee is alive,</hi> howſoever shee had given her name to Chriſt, 1 Tim. 5.6. In which reſpect alſo <hi>workes</hi> are called <hi>dead,</hi> Heb. 6.2. as declaring that they ar in deede dead that give themſelves up to the ſtudy &amp; love of them.

By the which it is taught, that if the Teachers would beſtowe faithfull and diligent paines, in cleanſing the whole doctrine and godlines, they should take away from many the occaſion of falling: but if they shall carry themſelves over negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in this matter, there would be a lamentable ruine of many. In the <hi>Antitype</hi> the thing is ſo cleare, that any man may bewayle it with teares, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to proſecute it in wordes. For how many excellent men hath that monſter of <hi>Vbiquity</hi> caſt headlong into death? The ſeedes whereof <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſowed in the yeare 1526. and 1528. in a diſputation againſt <hi>Zuinglius</hi> &amp; <hi>Oecola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>padius.</hi> But they ought to had bin pulled out againe of his bookes, at leaſt after the controverſy was brought a ſleepe, leaſt lurking as it were in the furrowes, they should breake forth at length into deadly hemlocke. But Luther himſelfe was careleſſe thereof, providing after the manner of men rather for his owne eſtimation then, as was meet, for the ſafety of the brethren. Moreover I doe finde lacke of thy faithfulneſſe and diligence, <hi>o holy Philip:</hi> becauſe thou haſt not thruſt through ſo foule an errour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deſert. Peradventure thou thoughteſt that it was to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled more gently of thee, partly in favour of thy friend, partly becauſe thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſedſt that it might be abolished by ſilence more eaſily then by sharpe inveiging of wordes. But the errours which are not refuted, ſeeme to be allowed, and their eſtimation groweth ſo much the more as they are dealt with more gently: for they are gangrenes, which gentle remedies doe not heale but make worſe. While therefore neither of you watcheth nor doth his duty, <hi>many dy:</hi> how many I pray, and how great men? An huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in deede of all degrees: of which the principall as ſtanderd-bearers wer <hi>Iohannes Brentius, Iacobus Andreas, Selnecerus, Kirchnerus, Chemnitius,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that ſorte, who have encreaſed this <hi>monſter of Vbiquity,</hi> of it ſelfe horrible, with ſo many and notable errours, that there hath bin ſcarce at my time any other more foule and deadly. Lamentable in deede is the fall of the famous men, whoſe labour was once courageous and no leſſe profitable againſt the comon enemyes. And what a crowne had they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:6819:49"/> if they had continued in the ſame warrefarre, and had not as cruell Elephants turned back of the enemyes, waſted their owne friendes. But my office is of an Interpreter and not of a quereller: and therefore I leave of theſe things. This <hi>death</hi> invaded not onely ſome perticalar men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo many whole cityes and provinces, as may appeare by the booke of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde</hi> publiſhed in the yeare 1580. which is not of ſo great force to ſtabliſh the errour with the conſent of ſo many, as to teſtify this miſerable calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the brethren. And to this errour touching the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>perſon of Chriſt,</hi> were many other alſo added, to wit <hi>of Originall ſinne,, of Free will, of Iuſtification, of Good workes, of the Lawe and Goſpell, of Indifferent things,</hi> and of <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> Therefore <hi>death</hi> aſſaileth with a manifoulde dart: how great muſt the ſlaughter be, ſeing ſhee caſteth to ground even with one, great troupes of men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For J have not founde thy workes perfit;</hi> The reaſon why ſo many fell into death.

Why feared he not, what might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to others, having tryed in himſelfe, into what caſe he himſelfe was brought in diſputing? But his eyes were holden, that he could not forſee for the time to come, and turne away this ſo grievous punishment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his people.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dation. Which alwayes at other times is wont to take the firſt place. But this new diſpoſition &amp; ſetting in order is not done rashly, teaching that in the latter times shalbe ſome, who refuſing errours should embrace the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6819:50"/> trueth. As we knowe was done, when the booke of Concorde began fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this occaſion, and ſo many viſitations undertaken, that the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as they ſpeake, might be rooted out utterly. For ſuch men followers of true godlines and iudgement, were converſant in the moſt inward bowels of this <hi>Sarden ſtate.</hi> Beſide many free Cityes, <hi>Strasburg, Heydelberg, Marpurg, Newſtadt, Breme, the peopell Anhaltine &amp;c.</hi> who oppoſed themſelves againſt the forgeries of the reſt. In every one of thoſe places famous lights now and then did shine, which driving farre away that darkenes, gave a ioyfull day to their flockes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Which have not defiled their garments:</hi> The garment is Chriſt himſelfe, the comon clothing of all the faithfull: of which in the parable, <hi>Friend howe ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meſt thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment,</hi> Mat. 22.12. And Paul more plainly, <hi>For all yee that have bin baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. But it hath a diverſe ſignification according to the diverſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of thinges, into which it is referred. In reſpect of <hi>God,</hi> it belongeth to <hi>iuſtification:</hi> in reſpect of other men, to <hi>ſanctification</hi> and <hi>profeſſion;</hi> in reſpect of our ſelves, to <hi>honour, glory, triumphe, ioy, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore theſe <hi>Sardens,</hi> kept their profeſsion of Chriſt ſincere and entyre from all the filth and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe monſtrous opinions. Although they alſo which by repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did awake fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe errours, may be ſaid to keepe their garments alſo pure. For they that are in Chriſt, are not eſteemed according to their former foul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, but according to their preſent apparell, wherewith all their fomer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes are covered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And therefore they ſhall walke with me in white,</hi> to wit, <hi>garments.</hi> Theſe are the ſame garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with the former, but a little differing in reſpect; for thoſe were of <hi>profeſſion,</hi> wherby the valiant ſouldiers of Chriſt did appeare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: theſe are of <hi>glory, triumphe,</hi> and <hi>ioye,</hi> which they shall enioy both in themſelves from the feeling of Gods love shed abroad in their harts, and alſo which they should receive fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prayſing of others, who shall prayſe <hi>God</hi> in their name, who hath beſtowed on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fortitude &amp; victory. <hi>A white and pure gowne</hi> in a ſolemne mirth is commendable, both among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles and alſo the <hi>people of God.</hi> From whence the wiſe man alluding to this manner, <hi>Let,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy garments be white alway,</hi> Eccl. 9.8. But eſpecially I thinke that of Marke is to be regarded, where ſome ſteppe of this celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all glory appeared in <hi>the ſhining garment, ſo white as ſnow, ſuch as no fuller can make on earth,</hi> ch. 9.3. At which ſight Peter beeing overwhelmed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable ioy minded this one thing, which way he mought have bin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enioy it alway. So this shalbe a moſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple reward for the ſaints in which they shall ſo hartely delight, that they shall deſyre no greater thing in this life.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:6819:51"/>
               <p>And if any should aske the brethren themſelves, whoſe theſe garments ar, I doubt not but they would anſwere, that this ioy is of more value, which they obtayne by Chriſt in retaining his truth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they would chaunge it with all the delight of this life. Certenly great is their glory among all the godly, which wee pray with all our harts to be perpetuall to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For they are worthy.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are glad in their owne behalfe for this words, as an excellent patron of their <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>condigne worthines:</hi> but let them remember that this merit is attributed to the <hi>garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> not to the <hi>body,</hi> that is to the <hi>imputation of the righteouſnes of Chriſt,</hi> wherewith we are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed as with a garment, not to our <hi>inherent holines;</hi> For <hi>not to defile the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> cannot be of more eſtimation, then <hi>the garment it ſelfe.</hi> And ſeeing there be ſundry ſignifications of the <hi>garments,</hi> as wee have shewed, the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thynes ariſeth not either <hi>from profeſſion of good workes,</hi> wherby the ſaints are ſeen of others, neither from the <hi>ioy of the Spirit,</hi> which wee our ſelves feele within us, but from this alone, that the father counteth us righteous being clotheth with his ſonne. He therefore is worthy that is clothed, though not of every uſe of garments, but onely of that peculiar reſpect, wherby we are preſented <hi>blameleſſe in the preſence of God:</hi> even as a man ſeeth, although not the whole man, but onely that part, to which the faculty belongeth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>He that ſhall overcome &amp;c.</hi> Some copies and the <hi>comon tranſlation</hi> read thus, <hi>He that ſhall overcome, ſhalbe ſo clothed.</hi> But the <hi>reddition</hi> of a ſimilitude is unuſuall, where there is no <hi>queſtion:</hi> unleſſe peradventure they be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the former verſe, as though he should ſay, as they that at all have not aſſented to errours, shall walke with me arayed in white apparell, ſo they that after ſome ſtriving shall departe from the ſame, shallbe clothed with white. As though the firſt reward were perteining to them that <hi>fell not,</hi> this to them that <hi>repented &amp; forſooke their errours,</hi> with which they were poſſeſſed before time. Of which ſorte were many in <hi>Germany</hi> before the booke of <hi>Concord</hi> was published, when in moſt univerſityes the chiefe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers underſtood the true doctrine of <hi>the ſupper of the Lord,</hi> and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Vbiquitie</hi> &amp; <hi>corporall preſence in the ſupper,</hi> every where were contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as witneſſeth Georg.

Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſ. which appeareth more clearly from the <hi>Synode of Deſdrenſe,</hi> in the yeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1571, where it was ordained by the comon conſent both of all the Superintendants of the Dukedome of Saxonie, and alſo of the Doctours of the Vniverſityes of <hi>Lypſia, and Wittemberg; That the Vbiquitie of the body of Chriſt, was an horrible prophanation of all the articles of the Creed, and a renewing of all Hereſyes,</hi> Gallobel. in the yeare 1592. And ſince that time a perfitter light breaking forth every day, many were rayſed up from their drowſines,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6819:51"/> and opened their eyes to the truth. Whom alſo even as well as the other, he adorneth with white garments, <hi>who gave a penny to them that were hyred at the eleventh houre,</hi> Mat. 20.9. Such then is the firſt reward, two yet doe remayne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And I will never put his name out of the booke of life;</hi> The ſecond reward applyed to the times. For becauſe very many in theſe tymes should fall from the trueth, and many cityes, peoples, provinces, regions, should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent to errour (as at this time it is evident how farre and wide the contagio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpread abroad, flying alſo over the ſea and infecting thoſe Northern regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Gotia and Suetia) by which their approving of errour they should blot their names out of the regiſter of the ſaints, and should cut of from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the hope of life, unleſſe they should repent, leaſt I ſay, the falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of ſo many, should trouble the ſaints, he biddeth <hi>his conquerours</hi> to be of good courage; <hi>Chriſt himſelfe</hi> would ſet them free from falling, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they should ſee infinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers to rush downe violently on their right and left hand. For it is he alone, who firſt calleth us backe from errour, then ſanctifyeth &amp; confirmeth us in the trueth, leaſt at any time we should revolte from it. Therefore howſoever this reward be full of confort, yet it teacheth that the time should be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table through the fall of many. For to betray and forſake the trueth, is not a light matter, as many ſuppoſe, who eaſily are caried away with every winde of doctrine, but it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man of no reckonning with God. But how, wilt thou ſay, can they be blotted out, which once <hi>were written in the booke of life?</hi> eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>this booke</hi> is the <hi>booke of the Lambe,</hi> as in the chap. 13. 8. that is, wherein thoſe that are written, the Lambe acknowledgeth them for his, &amp; counteth them heires of eternall life: neither is there any <hi>of thoſe that are given to Chriſt, that can ever periſh,</hi> Ioh. 6.37.39. &amp; 17.12. I anſwer that theſe things are ſpoken in reſpect of us. For there is a twofolde <hi>booke of life,</hi> one, as I may ſay, of <hi>vocation,</hi> an other of <hi>election.</hi> Into the firſt are put all, who by the preaching of the Goſpell are taken into the fellowſhip of the Church, who rightly doe ſeeme unto us to be partakers of life, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hope of eternall ſalvation. For the ſcriptures are wont to ſpeak ſo generally, <hi>giving thankes to the Father, who hath made us meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and tranſlated us into the kingdome of his deare ſonne, in whom we have redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by his blood, the forgivenes of ſinnes &amp;c.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the multitude of the Coloſsians without difference, chap. 1.12. And after the ſame manner every where in other places. Yet men may be put out of this booke. <hi>For many are called, but few choſen,</hi> Mat. 22.14. And it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:6819:52"/> after in the 7. chap. by an exemple, <hi>Dan and Ephraim being paſſed over in the rehearſing of the tribes,</hi> as ſouldiers put out of wages, and caſſed out of the regiſter.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded the genealogies of each tribe among the people of Iſraell to be kept diligently. Wherto alſo perteined that of rayſing up ſeed to the dead, <hi>that his name ſhould not be put out from his people:</hi> Deut. 25.6. In which reſpect alſo the Pſalmiſt wisheth to certen reprobates, who held a place in the Church, like true citizens, that God at length would ſeparate them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the congregation of the <hi>Saints</hi> and manifeſt them to be meere hypocrites, Pſal. 69.29. Wherefore all are put out of this kooke of life, who forſake the fellowship of the <hi>holy Church,</hi> either through errour and hereſy, or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, or other cauſe whatſoever: not that for this cauſe they are blotted out of the booke of <hi>Election,</hi> but becauſe by this way they make manifeſt, that they were never written in this booke; as Iohn ſaith, <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us,</hi> 1 Ioh. 2.19. But the other booke, to wit, of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is never ſpotted with any blottes, but the names once written in, doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly remayne in the ſame without raſing out. Although theſe bookes are not ſo open and evident, that they can be read of all men without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: but it is declared to every one ſeveralty by the <hi>Spirit</hi> that is found in this regiſter, in what eſtimation and account he is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ But J will confeſſe his name:</hi> The third reward is of <hi>confeſſing their name.</hi> Which sheweth not onely the falling away of many, but alſo that others ſhalbe compelled by force: So as there is great neede of the power of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> leaſt any weakened by the iniuries and threats of adverſaries, doe forſake the trueth. For the <hi>confeſſion of their name before his father,</hi> is for the confort of confeſsing Chriſt and his trueth boldly and without feare. So ſending his Apoſtles to preach, furnisheth and inſtructeth them againſt the feare of affliction, Mat. 10.32. And who knoweth not to what inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity &amp; cruelty proceeded the hatred of them who call themſelves Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, againſt the profeſſors of the truth? In the yeare 1580. was obtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded upon the Miniſters of the Churches, and Schooles the booke of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corde, avouching the execrable errour of <hi>Vbiquity.</hi> A ſubſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded in the name of the Princes, the refuſers were proclaimed <hi>Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taryes,</hi> or put out of their places.

But shee carrieth a ſweet name, and which alone conteineth within it all vertues. Neither found out the Apoſtle Peter any thing, when he would exhort to all godlines, which might commend more fitly the ſame unto us then brotherly unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned love, 1 Pet. 1.22. How well this name doe fit this Church, which is reproved of no ſinne openly! But as it was truly godly becauſe of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, ſo is shee lowly and not famous, both through a continuall feare of danger, and alſo ſolitarines of the cityzens, who dwelt here and there, and in waſte places, where they could get ſafe dwelling. Wherein shee is altogither contrary to Pergamus a towred and proude city, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sardis to Smyrna, and Thyatira to Epheſus. And ſo there is made 3. payre of contraries. It lyeth from Sardis toward the South, having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of greater light, as becometh a reformed Church. Shee is ſet in the ſecond place after Sardis (for this is the firſt after Ieſabell overcome) wher by is ſhewed that her <hi>Antitype</hi> is the ſecond reformed Church, which should ariſe after the Germane, and this is the Church of the Helvetians, Suevia, Geneva, France, Holland Scotland. I ioyne all theſe into one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they live almoſt after one and the ſame kind of lawes and ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, as touching the things that are of any moment. Neither doth the diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of place breake of that ſociety which the coniunction of mindes and will doth couple.

Wee shall finde that this Church which I ſpeake of aroſe a little while after the Germane; when <hi>Vlricus Zvinglius</hi> began to teach at <hi>Tigur</hi> in Helvetia, in the yeare 1519, and the reformation was begun the fourth yeare after, to wit, in the yeare 1523, at which time no Papiſt durſt enter into combate againſt Zuinglius, who did deferre the iudgement of all controverſyes to the arbitrement of the ſacred ſcriptures. They of Conſtance, Baſill, Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Geneva and others, followed their ſteppes. Where it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerved that the former Antitypes were diſtinguished by longer intervalles: theſe three laſt as they have types leſſe diſtant one from another by ſpace of place, ſo they are ioyned one with an other with a nearer coniunction of times, neither are they devided ſo much by ages and limites of yeares, as by lawes and cuſtomes. For after the firſt receiving, which happened to ſome later then to others: wee shall ſee that they did all flourish togither.</p>

Touching the city Philadelphia it ſelfe, we finde no other thing, but that in the age following, there abod in that place a famous congregation of the faithfull, over which <hi>Demas</hi> had the charge, as is gathered from the Epiſtles of <hi>Jgnatius.</hi> In the Antitype, a divine power ſpecially shineth forth ſanctifying the Church, by kindling the deſyre of godlines, and in making it in Chriſt Ieſus fit and cheerfull to every good worke. Let my wordes be without envy, the true doctrine ſoundeth no where purer, the worship leſſe corrupted, more flourisheth the faithfull di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligence of the Paſtours, is performed more willing obedience of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor greater reverence of all religion among all degrees. But this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſeemeth chiefly to reſpect manners. In which thing is not to be paſſed over that famous teſtimony of Iohn Bodin, ſpeking of them of Geneva; <hi>Of whom that thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is prayſe worthy, if any thing any where in the earth, and which maketh a comon wealth to flouriſh, if not in riches and greatnes of Empire, yet certenly in vertues and godlines, namely that cenſure of the Popes, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater and more divine could be deviſed to bridle mens luſts, and to repreſſe thoſe vices, which by no meanes could be amended by any humane lawes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How be it that this reſtraint is directed after the rules of Chriſt, firſt privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and friendly: after ſome what more ſharply: then if thou obey not, there followeth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6819:54"/> an heavie, grave and effectuall prohibition from the holy things; after the interdiction, is the puniſhement of the Magiſtrate.

There is the ſame care and fruit alſo of the reſt, according to the meaſure, which Chriſt vouchſafeth to every congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them.

Wee shall ſee this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trueth in the following Church to be diſtinguished by their proper wordes; both which the Greeke worde <hi>true</hi> ſeemeth to containe, when it is put abſolutely and by it ſelfe. And as touching trueth of doctrine, wher is it more pure and more ſincere in the whole earth? The whole Papacy hath here his throate cut. The Anabaptiſts, Antitrinitaries, Arians, and ſuch like monſters rayſed up againe from hell, partly in Germany, partly in Tranſylvania, have founde no where a fiercer enemy: What alſo hath it not aſſayed, that shee might pull away from the Germane Churches their errours? Neither doth shee keepe onely the doctrine of ſalvation uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, but alſo shee both delivereth and teacheth in writings and exerciſeth in practiſe a ſyncere ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of adminiſtring, wherby ſalvation is beſtowed. Certenly the whole will of God is communicated with his ſaints, ſo as Chriſt taketh to himſelfe not undeſervedly this prayſe of <hi>true</hi> in governing this Church: He doth alſo performe plenteouſly that which he promiſed, that he would keepe ſafe and ſound thoſe that ſeeke him with an upright heart. What have not endevoured <hi>the Franch man, the Spuniard, the Savoya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Pope,</hi> to roote out them of Geneva, a ſmall people, and environed on every ſide with enemyes, and shut up from all ayde of friends? Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it flourisheth yet ſtill thankes be to God, and shall flourish hereafter, while all her adverſaryes burſt with envy: as long as shee shall continue in this holy order. The French Church hath ben preſerved hitherto, no other wiſe then the three children in the fornace. Who would have beleeved that the <hi>Lowe Countryes</hi> had ben able to reſiſt and withſtande the raging Philip, the cruell Duke d'Alve, and ſo many bloudy Tyrants? But <hi>true</hi> is he, who hath promiſed this honour to his ſaints, that they should binde the Kings with chaines, and their nobles with fetters of iron, Pſalme 149.8.9. And that I may not ſpeake of every each one, they can be ſafe onely by thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, o moſt high God, who art conſtant in all thy promiſes, whom
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6819:54"/> both enemyes almoſt infinite doe perſecute with deadly hatred, and alſo to whom many of their freindes through envy wish not very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Who hath the key of David:</hi> The third property perteineth alſo to the ſame adminiſtration. Chriſt openeth and shutteth, to whom he hath thought it good, the entrance into the kingdome of Heaven, by his regall power. Which faculty in deede he beſtoweth upon all his, which doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and preach the worde purely and ſyncerely, but which is principally to be ſeen in that part of governement, wherby obſtinate ſinners which will not yeilde to admonitions, are delivered to Sathan by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſure, and are caſt out of the Church, which is the Kingdome of Heaven: according to that, <hi>Whatſoever yee ſhall binde on earth, ſhalbe bound in heauen, and whatſoever yee ſhall looſe in earth, ſhalbe looſed in heaven: For where two or three are gathered togither in my name, there am J in the middes of them:</hi> Mat. 18.18.20. By theſe therefore is shewed, that the power of opening and shutting, of binding and looſing is very effectuall in theſe congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and more over alſo the whole adminiſtration of the cenſures. And what godly man doth not thanke God from his heart, and extolleth not with worthy ptayſes the holy paines of this Church, which reſtored diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline fallen into decay, and brought it backe to the rule of trueth and uſe of the primitive Church?</p>
               <p>But it is to be obſerved, that this key was ſayd before to be the key of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> in the firſt Chapter and 18. verſe, by one part denoting the whole force of them. Therefore that key is to be feared, which locketh up the gate upon the wicked being thruſt into Hell, howſoever they deſpiſe the ſame with ſecurity: And yet notwithſtanding no leſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſant to them that feare God, becauſe it unlocketh to them the dores, by which they may enter unto life. But why is it called of <hi>David,</hi> ſeeing it is of Aaron rather, whoſe office was to keepe away the leprous and uncleane from the holy things, and to shut up the Temple againſt them? Certenly the Prieſt onely could pronounce men uncleane: he was not wont by an ordinary &amp; proper power to uſe force to compell the diſobedient. Chriſt both King and Prieſt is very mighty in both facultyes and powers, and ioineth togither both in this Church: who not onely rayſeth up Paſtours, that they should denounce men uncleane, but alſo together adioyneth the civile Magiſtrate, that he should give his ready and diligent labour to the Paſtors in this. So before <hi>Bod. the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Magiſtrate foloweth the debar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy things.</hi> Therfore both ſwordes are drawn in this Ch but ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one &amp; the other belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth. And indeede this ſociety is moſt ſweet, ſeeing all the induſtry of civill Magiſt. ought to have reſpect therto, <hi>that we may live with all godlines &amp; honeſty, 1 Tim. 2.2.</hi>

So the omitting of one worde, putteth a difference betweene the type &amp; the truth, <hi>Eliakim</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſt.</hi> See alſo Iſay 9.6.7.

And <hi>that ſpeach may be given unto mee in opening my mouth,</hi> Epheſ. 6.19. And worthily is it ſo called, ſeeing by the word a dore is opened to us into heaven, which being taken away and removed, the dore is shut and loked, ſo as noe man can enter in, Luk. 13.25. And not onely the faculty of the Miniſters is the doore, but alſo the readines of the hearers, as, <hi>For a great dore and effectuall is opened unto mee, and there be many adverſaries,</hi> as though he should ſay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be many that doe reſiſt and ſtrive againſt the truth, yet there are many, whoſe deſyre is prompt and ready, 1 Cor. 16.9. And againe, <hi>coming to Troas to preach the Goſpell, and a doore being opened to mee in the Lord.</hi> This dore is opened, when the hearts are opened to receive the truth, as <hi>Lyd a,</hi> whoſe heart the Lord opened, that shee might attende to thoſe things which were ſpoken of Paul, Act. 16.14. But although the name of dore be attributed to thoſe a parte, yet moſt of all the dore is then opened, when all theſe things meet ioyntly togither, the word, diſcipline, the care of the Magiſtrate and of the people. Then is there free leave to pearce into the conſciences of men; unto which an entrance is shut up after a ſorte, where any of theſe shalbe wanting. This then is that open dore, wherby this Church was famous. Which in deede no ſtrength of wit hath opened, which conſiſteth either in the vertu of ſpeaking, or in the sharpenes of wit and prudence in underſtanding, but onely that chiefe key-bearer, who hath given freely that which no man could have obtayned by humane ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth.

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Holde that which thou haſt, that no man may take away thy crowne:</hi> Goe on couragiouſly in the raſe wherein thou haſt begunne; keepe thy ſanctity of manners, purity of wholeſome doctrine, ſeverity of heavenly diſcipline, leaſt if thou shalt beginne to relent any thing in this matter, an other take thy crowne from thee. But what crowne is this? The honour which shee shall receive from the enemyes brought under her and worshipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her feete, ver. 9. Which manners of rewards doe depende on the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of godlines, unto which they are propounded, and are taken away ſome time from the ſaints for a correction of their cowardlineſſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they doe unskilfully, who tranſferre theſe things unto eternall life, as though that could had ben taken away from the elect, or at the leaſt wiſe, as though they should alwayes waver as for an uncerten and doubtfull

It may come to paſſe, and allwayes it cometh to paſſe, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked may deceave themſelves with a falſe perſuaſion. But the elect have the Spirit, who witneſſeth that <hi>they are the children of God,</hi> neither can he, the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thour of all trueth, either deceave or be deceaved, Rom. 8.16. Although if any thinke that there is the ſame reaſon of the earthly and heavenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, of which they will have that to be at leaſt a type, the ſame thing may be anſwered truly and rightly, which wee have ſayd before touching the booke of life, ver. 5. That many are called, but fewe choſen. Now the crowne may be taken away from them that are called not perſevering, the which for a time they did hope for: in which reſpect it is called not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe their crowne. But how doe they tryfle, who wreſt unto the elect, that which perteineth to the called onely, becauſe they invy that others ſhould have that certenty or aſſeurance of ſalvation, which themſelves feele not!

Salomon ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the two erected pillars with two names: The one on the right hand he calld <hi>IACIN,</hi> that is, he shall ſtablish; That on the left hande <hi>BOAZ,</hi> that is, in him is Strength, 1 King. 7.21. not onely shewing by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſelfe of the pillars, but alſo by the names, in what firme eſtate the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect doe ſtand before God, both preſent and future. For the preſent the children of God have ſtrength in themſelves: for the time to come, God will ſo ſtablish them by his grace, that they can never fall away from him altogither. Although that I may put you in minde alſo of this further, that they ſeeme to ſignify the two Churches: by that on the right hand <hi>Jacin, the Church of the Jewes,</hi> which God at length in his time should ſtablish, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving not yet gotten ſtablenes, becauſe of their harneded heart, wherby they should refuſe Chriſt, when he should come: by that on the left hand, <hi>Bohaz, the Church of the Gentils,</hi> becauſe of the preſent ſtrength which should be in it, when shee should embrabce Chriſt at the firſt hearing. So Chriſt would write names upon thoſe Pillars, better then thoſe <hi>Jacin &amp; Bohaz.</hi> For firſt he will imprint the name of his God, that it may be manifeſted to all men, that they have bin ſet at liberty to be Gods chiefe treaſure and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as it cometh to paſſe in things marked openly, which doe shew by their titles to every one that looketh on them, whoſe they are. In which ſenſe it was ſaid in the 9. ver. <hi>and they ſhall knowe that I have loved thee.</hi> In which reſpect alſo <hi>holines to the Lord is written upon the belles of the horſes,</hi> in Za<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chary 14.20. The ſecond name is of <hi>the newe Jeruſalem,</hi> of which in ch. 21.2 to which time this reward perteineth: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it is cleare that theſe 7 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles reſpected not onely the preſent condition of the 7 cityes, but by the

But ſo farre as pertineth to <hi>newe Ieruſalem,</hi> wee will ſhew in this place, that it is not that city which the ſaints ſhall enioy in heaven after this life, but a Church to be expected on earth the moſt pure and moſt noble of all that ever have bin hitherto. The rewards in a peculiar manner doe ſerve the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and if this felicity ſhalbe after the reſurrection, it ſhalbe comon to all the ſaints, not proper to this Philadelphia. This therefore ſignifyeth both that the Philadelphians ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue untill that reſtauratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in which new Ieruſalem ſhall come downe from heaven, &amp; ſhalbe converſant among men, &amp; alſo ſhalbe ioyned with the ſame in a league &amp; fellowſhip, ſhalbe indued with that heavenly city, &amp; enioy the ſame Law, privilege &amp; happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. At which time all ſhall acknowledge thy reformation not to be a thing deviſed of man as contentious men affirme, when they shall ſee the ſame ordinances to flourish in newe Ieruſalem. The third name is <hi>the newe name of ſonne:</hi> What can be new unto him? namely that which is not yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged of the world. Hitherto he hath ſuffered the tyrants to beare rule &amp; to treade under foote the name of Chriſt, as though he were a King onely in title, who should have right to reigne, but should want pover. But at length he shall riſe up, &amp; shall take a clubbe into his hande: he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all his enemyes, he shall give the triumphe to his ſpouſe, &amp; shalbe ce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lebrated King of Kings by all men through the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of the earth. Vnto the ſociety of which glory he shall take his ſervants, he shall deliver them from the calamityes, wherewith they are now oppreſſed, he shall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve them power over their enemyes, &amp; shall beſtow on them the whole glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of his Kingdome, as much as mortall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receive. And there is ſome difference betweene a <hi>newe name</hi> put abſolutely as in chap. 2.17. &amp; a <hi>newe name of ſonne.</hi> For that perteineth unto the certenty of adoption by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which faith was very weake in the Pergamen ſtate: this belongeth to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciety of the Kingdome, which shalbe communicated with his in the laſt times.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>Let him that hath an eare heare;</hi> Hear therefore <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, thou art lowe and nothing eſteemed, but God will exalte thee.

               <p n="14">14 <hi>And to the Angell of the Laodiceans:</hi> Laodicea ſituated at the river Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum: was once a great city and famous, abounding both in cityzens &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and alſo in all other things, as we ſhewed in the firſt chap. ver. 11. It was built by <hi>Antiochus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Stratonice,</hi> and for his wife <hi>Laodice</hi> her ſake, called this city <hi>Laodicea,</hi> as it were, the Princeſſe and ruler of the people, to whom ſhee ſhould adminiſter iuſtice and make lawes. From whence wee call her <hi>Glorious,</hi> great both by name, and alſo in their owe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which boaſteth <hi>that ſhee is riche, and wanteth nothing,</hi> ver. 17. It is from <hi>Philadelphia</hi> more toward the Eaſt then the South, being diſtant from it according to Ptolomy not above tenth ſcruples. Shee is the third city ſince there was mention made of <hi>Jezabell,</hi> the reproche of whom Sardis tooke away from the Churches. Shee hath this proper to her, that ſhee hath none, to whom ſhee can be oppoſed, as in the former Churches. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Epheſus</hi> was oppoſed <hi>Thyatira,</hi> to <hi>Smyrna Sardis,</hi> to <hi>Pergamus Philadelphia, Laodicea</hi> the ſeaven hath noe fellow. The Antitype is the third reformed Church, which before I note or ſhew, the uniuſt ſuſpicion and offence of ſome men is to be put away by intreaty. No diſeaſe or corruption of minde hath moved me to ſeeke out an odious application. No mans either ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:6819:59"/> or honours, God is witneſſe, grieveth mee. I am content with my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Neither have I counted any thing to be more fooliſh, then to pleaſe ons ſelfe by diſpleaſing others. But howe diſhoneſt and filthy a thing is it, to ſit as doth the fly upon the ſoares of the brethren? My ſoule hath all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abhorred ſuch dealings. But when I conſidered that theſe ſeaven ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyes were ſet forth for a type of all Churches among the Gentiles, and then alſo perceived the courſe it ſelfe of the time, and the mervaylous concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all things, I durſt not unfaithfully hide the truth with ſilenee, leaſt I ſhould make my ſelfe guilty of others blood. Farre be it, that I ſhould diſtaine willfuly that Church which through the mercy of God hath brought mee forth, nouriſhed and ſuſteined mee, which I deſire in my daylie prayers and labour, to be moſt bleſſed. But ſeeing the ſoare cannot be cured, unleſſe it be touched, neither truly touched without griefe, I thought I muſt not refuſe to caſt my ſelfe againſt what troubles ſoever, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to betray the ſalvation of her, of which every one of us ought to have greater regard and care then of his owne. Verily he that gathereth the teares of his children in his bottle, knoweth that I have not viewed round about this <hi>Laodicea</hi> with dry eyes. I could not but morne from the bottome of myne heart when I beheld in her <hi>Chriſt</hi> lothing us, and very greatly provoked againſt us. Wherfore let no man blame me for that, which not ſo much my wil, as the duty of a faithfull Interpreter compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me to bring forth. And I hope that the lovers of the truth will not deſpiſe and refuſe ſo equall and reaſonable requeſt: with which hope ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, but eſpecially with his ayde, who is the leader of my way and life, I will gird and make my ſelfe ready unto the thing it ſelfe. The Antitype I ſay, is the third reformed Church, that is, ours of England. For all the purer Churches are comprehended in this threefolde difference: For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they preſiſt and continue in thoſe ſteppes which Luther hath traced out, ſuch as are the Churches of Germany, eſpecially of Saxony, and thoſe next bordering of Suerland and Danemarke; or they abhorre that errour of <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> as all the reſt with one conſent: which yet doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all things, but follow a differing manner of governing and admini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtring, the French and their companions one, our Engliſh another, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten propre and peculiar one. Whereupon there are three diſtinct ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unto which the three types <hi>Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea,</hi> after that <hi>Iezabell</hi> was overthrowne, that is the yoke of the Romiſh tyranny ſhaken of, doe anſwere. And to the laſt <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the Engliſh doth agree, whoſe laſt original taketh her beginning at the yeare 1547. when Edward the King of moſt famous memory, came to the rule and governement of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:6819:60"/> common wealth, but then at length shee was confirmed and ſtablished, when 11 yeares after our moſt peaceable Queene Eliſabeth bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Moſt mighty King Henry her father had expelled the Pope, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the Popish ſuperſtition. And before he began to ſtirre any whit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt the Pope, the Churches of Germany and Helvetia were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Scotish Church is later in beginning then ours: yet by right it is numbred with them, with which it agreeth in ordinances: into whoſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes shee is caſt, which is to be eſteemed rather from the agreement of things, then alone from the difference of time. Wherfore our English Church alone conſtituteth the Antitype anſwering to Laodicea; as shee which began laſt of thoſe, in which there appeareth noe difference of any moment.</p>

The ſecond is taken not out of the viſion of the ſame chapter, but from the inſcription of the comon Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtle ver. 5. Neither is the third found in expreſſe wordes, but in the 8. ver. he is called <hi>the beginning and the end,</hi> from whence this ſeemeth to proceed, <hi>the beginning of the creature.</hi> The two firſt propertyes perteine to the double truth, one of <hi>promiſing,</hi> the other of <hi>teaching:</hi> in reſpect of that he is called <hi>that Amen,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>In him are all the promiſes of God yea and amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. in reſpect of this, <hi>a faithfull &amp; true witneſſe.</hi> As tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching that, Chriſt taketh this name upon him now, becauſe he should shew himſelfe very cleare &amp; famous in performing his promiſes. But what are they? All bleſſings of heaven, of earth of cattell, of children, of peace, of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, of good health &amp; the like, to them that obey the voyce of the Lord: but all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary things to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that refuſe. Deut. 28. Which how they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the <hi>Laodiceans</hi> is not plainly apparent to us, being deſtitute in this point of the light of the Hiſtory. As touching our England nothing can be more cleare then the excellent goodnes of God in this thing. For the ſpace of theſe 42. yeares &amp; more, what aboundance of all good things hath ben powred forth upon our Iland. He hath given us a moſt peaceable Queene, excelling ſo in all prayſe, as no age hath ſeene the like. Togither with her he hath given peace.

What should I uſe many words: hence is a porte &amp; place of refuge opened to the baniſhed for Chriſts ſake: affoardeth ayde to them that are oppreſſed by tyrants, neither have wee almoſt any other labour, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wee may helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that neede, &amp; all this even while our eares doe ringe of the noiſe &amp; tumulte of the nations round about us, no leſſe then as the waves of the ſea. England never had ſo long quietneſſe of dayes. At which our felicity ſtrangers are aſtoniſhed, our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are grieved, wee our ſelves almoſt knowe it not. But prayſe be to thee moſt true <hi>Amen,</hi> who hath given us this eaſe and reſt. In beſtowing lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely upon us ſo many good thinges, thou haſt ſhewed truly to the world, that thy Goſpell is a gueſt not going away ſcot free, which dot ſo aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly bleſſe thoſe that receive &amp; entertaine it. Keepe &amp; continue theſe good thinge unto us, yea thou wilt keepe them, which art <hi>Amen,</hi> if wee ſhall keepe and defende thy trueth.</p>

               <p>In this kinde of trueth he ſhould manifeſt him ſelfe in wonderfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in this Church. But touching the city of <hi>LAODICEA,</hi> we have noe more then before. In the <hi>Antitype</hi> thoſe former riches of his grace are in this thing, if it may be, ſurmounted and excelled. And to what end were all the good thinges, if wee could not have the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine of trueth? But ever ſince the firſt times of our moſt peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Queene, he hath rayſed up continually diligent and learned Paſtours and Teachers. who have preached the worde purely and ſyncerely. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this day are many wanting by his infinite mercy, who beſtowe all their labour in imperting to his people the whole will of God, and that pure and uncorrupte from all leaven of falſhood. Although not without cauſe in deede, one may mervayle howe in ſo diſorderly cuſtome &amp; licence to doe all things that they will (excepting the diffaming of the dignityes) the doctrine hath continued ſo long whole and ſounde.</p>

What hath not the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> endevoured and undertaken, that he might trouble our peace, partly by execrations, excommunications and bulles, ſounding an alarme to open rebellion: partly attempting privily, Ieſuites being ſent by ſtelth, and other privy murtherers who ſhould kill the ſacred Princeſſe with ſword, poyſon, torments, divelish artes, or any other way. Wee knouwe that not long agoe the <hi>Prince of Orenge</hi> was ſet upon with deſire to kill him,, by a popiſh cut throate, and was killed. Late is the memory of <hi>Henry King of France,</hi> whoſe murther <hi>Iacobus Clemens a monke</hi> attempted &amp; accompliſhed. And <hi>Henry the fourth</hi> who nowe enioyeth the ſoveraignty, eſcaped hardly the bloody handes of <hi>Iohn Caſtell</hi> the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> being ſtricken through the iawe bone with a knife, and two of his teeth daſhed out. But our Queene aſſailed of many at many times, with ſundry treaſons, hath ben kept whole and ſounde from the leaſt harme. From whence was this I pray? Was oportunity wanting to theſe wicked men. The alone Prince of the creature, to whoſe becke all things obey, hath laughed to ſcorne &amp; deluded the counſells of the wickel, repreſſed the endevours of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and made fruſtrate their ſubtill deviſing, and reſtrained them leaſt <hi>they ſhould touch his annointed,</hi> nor hurt <hi>the nurce of his Prophets.</hi> His power is noe leſſe famous in briddling the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with whom wee make warre nowe ſo many yeares. What is ther that he doth not thinke to effect by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who alone procureth trouble almoſt to all Europe and other parts of the world? The invincible navie of the yeare 1588, ſwallowed up in hope our whole country, our lives and goods. But good God howe was he diſapointed without any labour of ours, through all the ſeas coſt aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſcatered here and there and broken in pieces? He came out one way againſt us, and fled ſeaven wayes from before our face. This is thy prayſe alone o moſt mighty Governour, whom the windes, the waves, the harts and hands of men will they nill they doe obey. O ye Kings why doe ye not regard? Why doe you not <hi>learne, ye that iudge the earth?</hi> Will ye fight yet ſtill againſt the <hi>Prince of the creatures</hi> to your owne deſtruction? Yf yee ſhall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6819:61"/> goe on to be ſo made, wee in the meane time will betake us under his winges, by whoſe defenſe alone wee ſtande ſafe againſt all your aſſaults. Such is then the threefoulde property wherby <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſheweth him ſelf to be ſeene in this our <hi>Laodicea,</hi> to wit, <hi>conſtancy in promiſing, ſyncerity in teachting,</hi> then an <hi>invincible power in defending.</hi>

               <p n="15">15 <hi>I knowe thy workes, that thou art neither colde nor hotte.</hi> In declaring the greatnes of their ſinne, he maketh no mention of any good thing, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that of the other Churches, none of which was of ſo deſperate eſtate, noe not <hi>Pergamus neither Sardis,</hi> as to be voyde of all prayſe. But this evill, as though it could not endure the fellowſhip of any good thing heareth nothing but reprehenſion, without confirmation of any honeſty. Not but that there were many ſingular men, whoſe faithfulnes and diligence the Spirit might approve (for it can not be but that where Chriſt is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true witneſſe, there ſome ſhould take ſingular paines) but becauſe he reſpecteth the comon forme and outward face of the Church, namely of what quality it is, not ſo much for her owne ſake, as for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Angels,</hi> which was ſuch, as he that conſidered the matter but with indifferent eyes, he ſhall iudge her worthyly to be voyde and empty of all vertue. It is an horrible evill which refuſeth all fellowſhip with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And althoug by this ſilence, wee may be able to coniecture, how grievous the diſeaſe is, nevertheleſſe afterward it is deſcribed more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of what quality it is: and firſt, for more perſpicuity and clearnes, by a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyall of contraries: <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou art neither colde nor hotte,</hi> but ſome thing compact and ioyned togither of both. Whereupon this evill conſiſteth of a temperature and mixture of certen contraryes. Now he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him colde, who with a quiet minde can endure that the dutyes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines ſhould be neglected and deſpiſed, little or nothing at all regarding what manner of worſhipping eyther he himſelfe or other doe holde: him hotte, who doe boyle with a right affection and deſire through vehement heate and fervency, as ſcalding water, ſeething in the potte with a certen reſtleſſe motion, for ſo the Greeke worde <hi>zeſtos</hi> doe ſignify, of which ſorte are they which can by no meanes ſuffer ſuperſtitions and ungodly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but doe try all lawfull meanes, that there may be an amending. For <hi>hotte,</hi> is not here ſinnefull, as is a raſh zeale as it cometh to paſſe in habites, in which both extreames doe ſwerve from the right: but it is of prayſe: As Apollos being fervent in Spirit, Act. 18.25. And Paul exhorteth that <hi>they be fervent in Spirit,</hi> Rom. 12.11. Yf by exceſſe he ſhould degenerate from the trueth, <hi>lukewarmnes,</hi> holding the middes, there were ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honeſty. But <hi>fervency</hi> or <hi>Zeale</hi> is an affection, following the love of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6819:62"/> holines, with a great and earneſt affection of minde; whoſe defect, whether that more removed of coldnes, or this, nigher of lukewarmnes, is blamed. And lukewarmnes placed in the middes of theſe extremes in that, wherby a man ſtaying himſelfe from committing grievous ſinnes, embraceth god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, ſo farre as may be enough to maintayne the reputation of an honeſt, prudent, and civile man. The College then of the Laodicean Paſtors, was as it were a Senat of prudent and moderate men in the matter of religion. Even as at this day the <hi>lukewarme</hi> have the report comonly &amp; in every place. Yet it is not playnly mentioned from what mixture of thinges this luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnes did ariſe. Before theſe times of <hi>Iohn, Paul</hi> biddeth the <hi>Colloſſians,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>ſay to Archippus,</hi> who then was the <hi>Paſtor of the Laodicean Church, that he would looke to fulfill in the Lord, the miniſtery which he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Col. 4.17. From which things appeareth that the Paſtorall faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes began then to ſhake and leane, which afterwardes fell moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, when the Spirit ſent theſe Epiſtles to the Angels. In our England the matter is more cleare, where there is ſuch a forme of Church eſtabliſhed, as is neither colde nor hotte, but ſet in the middes, and made of both. It is not colde, in as much as ſhee profeſſeth the helthfull, pure, and entire doctrine of ſalvation, wherby wee have bidde fare well and forſaken the Romiſh Antichriſt, and have ryſen from that cold death, wherein wee lay before time. Hotte in deede ſhee is not, whoſe outward government for the moſt parte, is yet ſtill Romiſh: <hi>In the degrees of their Clergie, in Elections, and Ordinations, and whole adminiſtration of the Cenſures:</hi> Which mixing of the pure doctrine and Romiſh regiment togither, maketh this lukewarmnes, wherby wee ſtande in the middes betweene <hi>cold</hi> &amp; <hi>hotte;</hi> betweene the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> of both which wee are compact, as <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> of godly memory, complayneth in a certen Epiſtle ſent to a moſt beloved friend of his, at Cambridge, written in Ianuary 12. in the yeare 1553. He in the tymes of King Edward the VI. was uſed amonge other, who ſhould determine the reforming of our Church. But in what thinges both his owne and Peter Martyr his authority prevayled he himſelfe manifeſteth in that Epiſtle even nowe ſpoken of: for ſo he writeth: <hi>Whereas thou putteſt mee in minde of the purity of the rites and ceremonies, know thou, that there noe ſtranger is asked concerning thoſe things; yet of our ſelves, when wee may, wee fayle not to doe our duty by writtings, and in preſence, and chiefly that the people may be provided of true Paſtors, after alſo of the moſt purity, both of doctrine and ceremonies.</hi> And in an other place, <hi>There be ſome who by moſt humane wiſdome and vaniſhing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, would ioyne togither God and Beliall, by the leaven of Antichriſt.</hi> Theſe things he did write, which wee at this day finde by experience too true.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:6819:62"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ J would thou wert colde or hotte.</hi> I would to God that thou wert either wholy <hi>Romiſh,</hi> or at lenght admitte a full reformation. He ſheweth the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible greatnes of the evill by compariſon, wherein he preferreth a wicked and noe religion, before this mingled lukewarmnes. But doth not luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmnes come nearer too good? From whence then hath it more fautie? Certenly ſinne is more ſinfull, where grace is more plentifull. The fall of the Angels in heaven, left to themſelves noe way to obtayne pardon. The ſinne of our firſt parents was more wicked being committed in paradiſe: moſt foule was the Idolatry of the five &amp; twenty men committed be tween the gallery and the Altar it ſelfe, Ezech. 8.18. God wilbe ſanctifxed in them that approch unto him; and ſuffereth more eaſily his grace not to be knowne, then to be deſpiſed: <hi>The ſervant that knoweth his maiſters will &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not, ſhalbe beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Wherefore <hi>if Baal be God follow him; why halt ye betweene both?</hi> As though it were hard to iudge whether were better. God abhorreth to come into this tryall. There is more ſound iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement in him, who not knowing the trueth, continueth in his ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then in him who being ſomewhat inlightned, is toſſed this way &amp; that way, uncerten ſtill what to follow. Therefore a meane here is worſt of all: which under a ſhew of prudent moderation and tranquility; is honoured of the world, which God eſteemeth leſſe then his next extreemes on both ſides. It is then better to fall away to Rome? Be it farre from us. For in this place Chriſt preferreth the blinde Papiſts before thoſe Angels, who bewitched with ambition and covetouſnes, doe refuſe holy reformation. He ſaith not that the condition of the whole Church is worſer, to which the true foode of ſalvation is miniſtred, whereof noe power is granted in the Romiſh Church.</p>

                  <hi>¶ It ſhall come to paſſe that J will vomit thee:</hi> As it cometh to paſſe in meates, which either hotte or cold, are reteined of the ſtomache becauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding quality, which cauſeth feeling, and exciteth the ſtomacke to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it: but that which is lukewarme, becauſe of his nigh and familiar heate, neither in entring is felt, neither being entred is it for that cauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, but remaining idle, and bringing at length trouble by his tarying there, is thruſt out of dores with vomiting as an unprofitable gueſt. But we muſt beware that ſimilitudes be not wreſted, beyond that which they doe intende, as though naughty and wicked men should remayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in Chriſt, as cold meates in the ſtomacke. For ſuch were never in Chriſt: neither doth he tell what he doth approve ſimply, but what he pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferreth. Furthermore the thinges are referred to his externe adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherby he beareth longer with the notably negligent, or rather all togither ſtrangers then lukewarme, as the experience of all times proveth, &amp; at this day wee ſee in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> which although shee hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken utterly the trueth, hath flourished a longe time, when in the meane time God rebuketh forthwith the true, neither differreth chaſtiſment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any long time, if he shall ſee them ſlacking a little their earneſt affection, and to leane more to lukewarmnes. But what is it to be vomited out of his mouth? Will Chriſt, in whoſe mouth and lippes the very trueth reſteth and abideth, take away his trueth from this Angell, delivering him up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to abſurde opinions, and that he ſhould beleeve lyes againe? The itching deſyre of many men at this day, to give againe to the people monſtrous &amp; reiected opinions, maketh this interpretation probable. Wee knowe what is taught within theſe fewe yeares in the Schooles, is preached uſually in the aſſemblyes, is diſputed at the publike Comices, and was publiſhed in print the laſt ſommer. But this ſhould be the puniſhement as well of the people as of the Angels, to whom it ſeemeth to be proper. Therfore I have noe certenty touching this matter. Surely the event will declare ſhortly. In the meane time let us knowe that this ſhalbe a fearfull puniſhement: for firſt Chriſt will take great pleaſure. in reiecting from himſelfe this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell. For what can be more pleaſante to a man that hath a diſpoſition and will to vomit, then to be eaſed by and by of the cauſe of his griefe? Even as <hi>Moſes threatneth to the Apoſtate Iewes, that Iehovah will ſo reioyce in deſtroing and rooting them out, as before he reioyced to doe them good, Deut. 28.63.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe he will caſt out this <hi>Angell</hi> with greate diſhonour. For an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane place is ſought for vomiting: howſoever <hi>Antonius</hi> in the aſſembly of the people of Rome governing the publike buſineſſe, filled his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome and the tribunal with gobbets of meate. Thirdly, that the <hi>Angell</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:6819:63"/> ſhall never recover his former dignity. For farre be it that the <hi>Prince and Authour</hi> of all cleanneſſe, ſhould ever returne to his vomit, But this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement was not to be inflicted to the whole <hi>Laodicean Church,</hi> but to the Angell alone, that is, to all lukewarme Paſtours, partly becauſe of that which wee ſpake even nowe, partly becauſe the <hi>Church</hi> is wont to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionned expreſſely, where ſhee is intreated of. As unto <hi>the Epheſine Angell, I will remove thy candleſtick out of his place,</hi> chap. 2.5. It ſhall therefore be peculiar to the Eccleſiaſticall men without the deſtruction of the whole Church. Neither is it to be doubted but the ſame at length happened to the <hi>Laodicean Angell,</hi> which here is denounced: The which thinge is alſo certenly to be expected in his Antitype, unleſſe ſhee ſhall prevent it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For it ſhall come to paſſe that that faithfull witneſſe ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe this <hi>whole Hierarchy,</hi> and not alwayes ſuffer men, ſeeking onely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and riches, not thoſe things which are Chriſt, to enioy even this falſe f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>licity. Certenly a great and reprochfull iudgement abideth thoſe lukewarme ons. Of which though they be troubled with noe feare, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with their terrour put to flight all the noyſe there of: yet though all ſhall hold their peace, he will not deceive, who hath threatned that he will puniſh. It is alſo to be feared, that the Church may feele ſome adverſity through contagion and conſenting to. Such as are the Angels, ſuch beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſhee for the moſt part: and none is ſo ignorant of the matters, who ſeeth not plainely that the whole body is ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe. <hi>But have mercy upon us o thou beginning of the workmanſhippe of God; deale not with us accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to our ſinnes, thou knoweſt our making, that wee are duſt and aſhes. How ſhould not earth wax cold? Rayſe up in us the burning heate of thy love: diſſolve J pray thee our yce: neither ſuffer us to pleaſe our ſelves in our miparted godlines, but kindle us with thy heavenly fire unto a full heate and fervency, that wee may both avoide thy lothſomnes of us, and may alwayes enioy that pleaſantnes, which thou giveſt to them whom thou loveſt: Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>¶ For thou ſayeſt I am riche:</hi> Thus was the nature of the ſinne. The cauſe is double, <hi>a falſe perſwaſion of their owne worthynes, and ignorance of their miſery.</hi> That grew from their wealth, which was of earthly and not ſpiritual ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, for againſt theſe he oppoſeth the riches, which he biddeth the <hi>Angell</hi> to buy of him in the next verſe. Neither could he have ben lukewarme if he had expected ſpirituall riches from any other then from Chriſt alone: but rather throughly cold, and altogither a ſtranger from grace, being <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come voyd and ſeparated from Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 5.4. But he ſeemeth to have aboun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in earthly riches, becauſe of the wealth of the city which wee ſpake of chap. 1.11. For which cauſe peradventure <hi>Archippus</hi> was more negligent
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6819:64"/> of his miniſtery, whereupon Paul would that he ſhould be admoniſhed: Col. 4.17, although ſmall fruit ſeemeth to have followed thereof, ſeeing that even unto theſe times of this Revelation, there was ſo great matter of boaſting: and that alſo not newly bred, but gathered from old time. The abondance therfore of things for this life, begate this lukewarmnes. And it is noe newe thing, that proſperity doth ſteale away our mindes, &amp; draw men away from God. This warning is often in the lawe, <hi>that they ſhould take heede to themſelves, leaſt being fullfedd, and filled with good things, they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Iehovah.</hi> And the boaſting is threefolde, the firſt of the <hi>preſent wealth:</hi> The ſecond of <hi>long continuing;</hi> The third <hi>of a perfit and abſolute to every uſe.</hi> For ſo the wordes require, that <hi>J am rich,</hi> ſhould be referred unto the preſent riches: <hi>I have ben rich,</hi> unto thoſe that are paſt; <hi>I want nothing,</hi> unto a certen fulnes. From which further muſt needs ſpring a certen perſuaſion of a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manent ſtate, and alſo conſtant felicity for the time to come, And it is to be obſerved that he bringeth in this Angell boaſting in his owne wordes: otherwiſe then was done hitherto; &amp; yet this not in vaine, ſeeing nothing is uttered rashly of the <hi>H. Ghoſt.</hi> But as touching the <hi>Anghel of Laodicea</hi> a clearer application offereth not it ſelfe: In our England the congruency is ſo manifeſt, that nothing could have bin expreſſed more lively. For what other cauſe can wee bring of our lukewarmnes, the Popiſh gouvernement mingled with the pure doctrine, then the love of riches &amp; honours? Men ſuffer not this hope to be taken from them: but they had rather have a halfe godlineſſe, togither with the inioying of their riches, then a full and perfit reformation with the loſſe of them. Yet leaſt they ſhould ſeme to preferre any thing before the trueth with diſhonour, they prayſe ſome what proud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly our preſent happines in the publiſhed bookes and in the aſſemblyes: as wee may ſee from the writings of many men, which have come forth in theſe laſt yeares. Not without cauſe therfore the <hi>Spirit</hi> maketh this <hi>Angell</hi> vaunting him ſelfe, but in the ſame ſetting before our eyes our notable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. And wee have ſaid that the firſt bragging was of the preſent riches. Howe doth our Angell triumphe in this reſpect? and lifteth up the head above all other reformed Churches? In other places there are poore and baſſe Paſtores, almoſt of a vulgar ſtate &amp; condition; nor of any greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, then their godlines and learning can procure unto them, But our Biſhops are Peeres of the Realme, ſuperiour in honour to many great ſtates: alſo in riches, company of men and mayd ſervants, in magnificence of houſes and all the other pompe of the world, equall to any even the greateſt Earles. Howe riche is the reſte of the Clergy? The Deanes, Arch-Deacons, Prebendaries, Chaplaines, heaping and gathering togither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6819:64"/> benefices, as they call them, doe match Squires at leaſt in early reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Doe not this amplify and encreaſe very greatly the glory of the Church, that her miniſtres doe ſhine in garments of ſilke and Velvet, doe walke in the ſtreetes with the retinue of noble men, &amp; ſo drive farre off the contempte of the miniſtery? Where canſt thou ſee after the Pope expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, a Church to reioyce of ſo rich thinges and of ſuch proſperity? No where in deede; neither doe I envy or grudg at it; onely our reioycing is not good. And would God that our riches did ſerve to the promoting of Gods glory, rather then to the hindring thereof; but they have brought in this miſerable lukewarmnes, whyle that wee may retayne them, wee make noe reckoning of true godlines. The ſecond boaſting is of the long continuance: For this plenty it not newe, but which hath ben confirmed nowe by the ſpace of two and fourty yeares. With how great proſperity of all things. Who may be ſo bolde as to reprove the condition of this Church as maymed and imperfect, which the experience of longe time hath approved to be moſt happy? Not I in deede, unleſſe proſperitie were an argument rather of Gods patience, then of mans Iuſtice. In the third place he vanteth that <hi>he wanteth nothing:</hi> What telſt thou mee, ſaith he, of other <hi>reformed Churches?</hi> I ſee no cauſe why other <hi>reformed Churches,</hi> ſhould not imitate ours, rather then wee them, ſeeing wee are inferiour to them in nothing. The anſwere to the admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to the Parliament, pag. 226. Yea why doeſt thou call me backe unto the firſt Church? As though wee were to be bounde with the firſt beginnings and principles, as with fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And it were not lawfull for us, to alter thoſe thinges, which at their firſt originall were not ſo profitable, as at this day they ſeeme hurtfull, this is in a certen Apol. of the governement of the Church, pag. 81, A bould, that I may not ſay ungodly, aſſertion, to affirme that any thing ordained of the Apoſtles, ſhould be noe leſſe noxious to our Churches then profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, for which they were appointed. But I remitte this to the heat of contention. In the meane time let ſuch a man knowe, that the Apoſtles Church was moſt perfit, and was not to be made perfit by the inventions of them that came after, but that all other are to be tryed and examined by the ſquare thereof. That ſaying of the firſt Councill of Nicen is to be celebrated, which is, <hi>Let the olde cuſtomes holde.</hi> And that alſo of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Praxeam, Beholde, whatſoever is firſt, that is true: and whatſoever s later, that is falſe.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, but that <hi>Paul</hi> taught <hi>Tim.</hi> moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how he (hould <hi>behave himſelfe in the houſe of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. Is all that inſtruction abrogated for oldneſſe? Should the time teach better &amp; more certen things, to which thoſe Apoſtles ſhould give place?</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:6819:65"/>
               <p>Surely the <hi>Church,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt beginning was pureſt; the farther shee proceedeth, the more filth shee gathereth, unleſſe God extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make the light to shine out of darknes, as lately in this laſt age. That firſt Church was the <hi>garden of Eden,</hi> as wee have shewed in chap. 2.7. The Church of the following ages compared with that, was a wide and barren wildernes. Perfection is not to be meaſured by multitude of profeſſors, or by amplitude of riches, but by the integrity and purenes of God his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and aboundance of heavenly gifts. Let it be then enough to prayſe mens inventions, let us tread under foote the ſacred trueth in compariſon of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And knoweſt not that thou art wretched;</hi> The other cauſe of the evill is the <hi>ignorance of their miſery.</hi> For proſperity blindeth the minde of the world, that it cannot ſee in deede in what ſtate it is. Therfore in many wordes he declareth this miſery, becauſe in ſo deepe a drowſines a light upbraiding would not cauſe any feeling. he maketh a fivefold degree of it. Of which the two firſt are as certen comon accidents; the three laſt doe shewe the very kinde of the diſeaſe. For the remedy is threefold, <hi>of golde, of garments, &amp; eye ſalve</hi> in the verſe following, and teacheth that the diſeaſe conſiſteth chiefly in theſe three thinges. The <hi>accidents</hi> are referred either to his owne <hi>ſenſe,</hi> or to the <hi>compaſſion</hi> of others: in reſpect of that, the <hi>Angell is wretched,</hi> in reſpect of this, <hi>miſerable.</hi> A man is <hi>wretched,</hi> who is conſumed with ſome great ſorrowe, whether it aryſeth from a publike calamity, or from ſome private and domeſticall griefe. And there is none placed in any dignity whatſoever, who can keepe himſelfe from this anguish, whereupon <hi>Kinges</hi> in the tragedies lament that they ſo often are wretched. Such heavineſſe of minde did lie once upon the <hi>Angell of Laodicea,</hi> as is at this day in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Howe, wilt thou ſay, where noe publike calamity preſſeth? The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaketh of private ſorrowe, as is evident from the glorying of this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,</hi> for which there can be noe place in a comon mourning and ſorrow. but this interior griefe doth torment miſerably the <hi>Engliſh Ang.</hi> For how great griepes doth he feele, who deſyreth exceedingly riches &amp; honours, and cannot get them? Or at leaſt who cannot enioy ſecurely thoſe things being gotten, whom many godly and learned men doe inveigh againſt with moſt grievous wordes? and not this onely, but alſo doe prove mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly from the trueth of God, that ſuch dignityes are unmeete for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, and that they cannot ſtande togither with the faithfulnes of <hi>Paſtor</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops?</hi> Howe muſt it needes be that theſe diſturbers should be very grievous, eſpecially ſeeing this opinion is now favoured of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: and the nobility hath perceived plainly long a goe the trueth of it?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:6819:65"/> Yf one could ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breſt of this <hi>A<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dgell,</hi> doubtleſſe he might ſee his heart almoſt conſumed with this griefe, howſoever without all things are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth flourisheth with happy tranquility. And I doubt not but that the Angell will confeſſe, that I have touched his moſt inward ſenſe in this thing. This Angell is miſerable to others; not to the wicked <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to whom the former griefe is not ſufficient, but to the godly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, both at home and in other nations, who being free of all partiality doe acknowledge the condition of the Biſhops &amp; other Clergie, who doe give themſelves wholy to ambition, and labour for honours, to be miſera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble &amp; unhappy, howſoever it doth very greatly pleaſe our ſelves. For what is worthy of more pitty then to ſee brethren ſnared with the vaine glory of the world, altogither to deſire and to enforce themſelves to get earthly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnityes, and to make shipwracke of the heavenly crowne? Yf they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lyen in the ſnares of the Devill, the thing were not ſo much to be la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mented; but after that they have eſcaped from his ſnares by the holſome knowledge of the goſpell, be entangled againe in the ſame by this way: what godly man cannot both be grieved at their change, and alſo bewayle the comon miſery of us all, which by a thouſande meanes are drawen into the ſame deſtruction? Such therefore are the <hi>accidents,</hi> grievous indeede of themſelves, yet but as a flee biting in compariſon of the diſeaſe it ſelfe: which nowe let us touch, as gently as wee can, and with the minde onely to heale, and not to exaſperate it. The firſt matter to be purged is <hi>poverty.</hi> And <hi>konweſt not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou art poore:</hi> Of what ſorte of poore? not <hi>poore in Spirit</hi> of whom Chriſt ſpeaketh Mat. 5.3. for this is a bleſſed pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that a wretched. Alſo the Angell boaſteth that he is and hath ben rich, and that he wanteth nothing, ſo that he is farre from that holy humility. This poverty therfore is the timorous begger lives, which both quaketh at the ſight of a richer man, nor either ſpeaketh or doeth ought, but to the pleaſure of a mightier man, and alſo which ſuſteineth the wretched life by begging mony and reliefe: For the greeke worde <hi>ptacos, poore,</hi> hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me both from fearfulnes, and alſo he is noted with the ſame name of him that laying at the gate of the rich man, deſyred to be fylled with the crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, which fell from his table, Luke 16.20. Which of theſe agreeth to our Angell? Is not all this dishoneſt covetouſnes removed farre from ſo great riches as are miniſtred to ours? I would to God it were in deede: but here as alwayes I am compelled to admire the infinite wiſdome of God, who hath opened our ſecret impoſtume, with a word ſo fit for the thing, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ever could be ſpoken or thought more fit. For firſt, howe ſervile a feare poſſeſſeth the Angel, from hence may eaſily appeare, that he ſpeaketh
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:6819:66"/> almoſt nothing, which he thinketh may diſpleaſe any one. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> doe feare the <hi>Peeres:</hi> the <hi>Pariſh Paſtors,</hi> the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whom they perceive to be ready to ſcourge them, if any provoked at home, will crave their aide, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if he can obiect their minde to be out of love with ſome ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. So reprehenſions are ſilent, naughtines reigneth, the hand of God is heavy upon us, and whither the matter will growe at laſt, prudent men feare not without iuſt cauſe. But chiefly <hi>the beggery of asking</hi> is notable. For runne over with your eyes and mindes the whole Clergy. Will yee that wee beginne at the weakeſt? Thoſe that they call <hi>Curates,</hi> both in very trueth &amp; alſo in the iudgement of all men, are beggers. In whom wee may ſee that which was threatned to the family of Ely, <hi>men bowing themſelves for a piece of ſilver, and a maſell of bread, and requiring to be ioyned to one of the Prieſts, that they may eate a piece of bread,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.36. In the reſt, who through their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboundance walke more underpropt, what running up and downe? what bountifull giving and bribes? What importunate and earneſt intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Howe great flattering intiſements of humble ſervice and ſoothing of all duties, that they may procure to themſelves Eccleſiaſticall offices? Very many doe fly unto the Kings Court, or to the houſe of a moſt noble man <hi>the Lord Keeper of the Great Seale.</hi> For theſe places are like the beautifull gate of the <hi>Temple of Salomon:</hi> in this, men enter in great multitudes, and there is great hope of carrying away the penny, Act. 3.2. Others followe the <hi>States and Peeres,</hi> to whom they become either domeſticall Chaplaines, or that I may ſo ſay, vaſſals: For what cauſe I pray? That aſſoone as any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, as they call it, shall happen to be voyde, they may enioy the ſame by the gift of their Lords. And this is thought to be an honeſt way to get an Eccleſiaſticall charge. But is not this flattery meer beggery? In obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a divine office is favour any whit leſſe diſhoneſt then mony? Yf wee will weigh the matter rightly, it is of the ſame fault and blaſme, to enter either by bribe, or by favour. The other rable is diligent about the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſorte of <hi>Patrons</hi> in the Country, in whoſe Porches they ſet, flatter and ſpeak fayre to their wyves, flatter their children, Winne their fervaunts by gifts: and in every place behaveth himſelfe like wretched beggers. Some more craftily, even as they, which ſit in a way having two pathes, and in publick wayes doe offer pilled roddes and ſticks to them that travayle by, to the end that they may get ſome mony: ſo they either by bountifull giving of preſent mony, or by agreement to give a certen yeerly rente, doe make a waye for themſelves.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, this is the corruption not of our Lawes, but of the men. Certenly as longe as this way to obtayne Eccleſiaſticall charges hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:6819:66"/> which hitherto hath prevayled, noe remedy can be brought for this beggery. Have wee not knowne this ſufficiently by experience? In the late aſſembly <hi>of all degrees of the Realme,</hi> a ſore and heavy ordinance was made againſt it; hath ought ben effected thereby? Nothing at all, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely that the thing be done more warily and ſubtily. Wee avayle nothing with our lawes, where the Lawes of Chriſt are not kept. But that wee may proceede, when the thing is begged of the Patrone, howe much leſſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe remayneth to the unlearned route, to obtayne <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop? Here not onely humble requeſt muſt be made to the chiefe Lord, but <hi>to the Examiners, Groomes of the chamber, Clarkes, Buttlers,</hi> yea to the leſſe Iacke, not becauſe ignorance shall keepe him from an entrance, but becau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe he is wont to bring moſt gaine to the ſervants, who hath neede of more favour. There is <hi>noe Tower made ſo ſtronge, which an aſſe loaden with Golde doth not vainquiſh.</hi> Neither any almoſt ſo unlearned or foolish, which taketh the repulſe. But what engines and crafty meanes are uſed, let them looke to it.</p>
               <p>There is the ſame conſideration of <hi>Prebendaryes, Archdeacons, Deacons.</hi> Are the <hi>Biſhops</hi> themſelves voyde of this avarice? What meaneth then that often attending at the <hi>Court</hi> and on the <hi>Peeres of the Realme?</hi> Why wayte they not tyll they be ſent for? Why are they not pulled againſt their wills from theyr ſtudyes? Yea if any should appeale to their conſciences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are thoſe fatte manoures and farmes of their <hi>Biſhoprikes</hi> let out to hire of their owne accord to farmers that longed for, or promiſed bribes to the adiutours of their dignity? But are they onely beggers in ſuing for the office? Some indeede are come to that beggery, that if their ſeate be to be changed, they pay not their firſt fruites, except they have raked togither shamefully ſome almes from the poore <hi>Rectours under the name of a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> Thou art therefore a Begger o thou <hi>Engliſh Angell.</hi> And therefore with thee it is ordinary and uſuall, that the beſt are paſſed over, and others leſſe worthy, are in better eſtimation. For as wee beſtowe ſome almes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the blind, lame, and thoſe that are full of ſores, wee ſtoppe our eares againſt them, whom wee ſee to have a body well liking and in comely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, ſo men of a blind minde, deformed and maimed doctrine, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty underſtanding, doe gather togither much almes, when they that have more learning and farre better iugement, are ſufferred to hunger and to perish through famine, which cometh to paſſe eyther becauſe they cannot cry out ſo ſtoutly, or becauſe they are more ashamed to begge, or becauſe men have leſſe pitty of them.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:6819:67"/>
               <p>But it is not my purpoſe to pleade their cauſe, thy beggerlines <hi>o Angell,</hi> is to be reproved of mee, which wilt thou, nilt thou, thou canſt not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, if thou wey the thing with thy ſelfe in earneſt. Thou doſt abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de indeede in riches, but nothing is more filthy then the way of getting them. Shall the begger, after he hath filled his purſe with asking almes, caſt away his patched cloake, and in ſilke vaunt him ſelfe to be rich &amp; weal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thy? What other thing is thy boaſting, then the bragging of riches, which thou haſt gathered moſt dishoneſtly by begging? And yet I doe not ſpeak theſe things to that end, as though the ſtipend of the godly Paſtors, who holily both enter into and execute their office, should be meere almes. For the labourer is worthy of his wages; neither can this diſtribution be ſayd to be freely beſtowed, any more then is any made to one which liveth of his publike office. God which made the earth, hath ſo given it to the children of men, that he reſerveth a portion to himſelfe, which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, who earneſtly bend themſelves to holy things. Therefore the Patrones doe not give of their owne, when they doe appointe the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rents to the Paſtours of the Churches for their paines, but deliver them to thoſe, to whom they are due, and of which they have ben the keepers onely. Wee ſpeake not, I ſay, of ſuch ſpeciall perſons, but generally of the ſtate of the Clergy, the manner of which is ſo ordained, that the Angell ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſtly groweth rich by almes, and in deede is noe other thing, then a Lord Begger. There is added to beggery <hi>blindenes,</hi> wherby the evill becometh farre more grievous: For what is more pittifull then a blind begger, whom neceſsity conſtreineth to ſeeke his living abroade, and the want of ſight ſuffereth him not to ſeeke? But this is a blindnes of minde, wherby a man being deprived of a witty and prudent minde, cannot provide for himſelf touching things profitable and honeſt before God and men. The Angell then being voide of this wiſdome, ſinneth even ſo in adminiſtring his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, as of late he ſinned by beggery in the manner of getting. And this is the worſt kinde of blindnes, which for the moſt part, neither acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his owne darknes, neither can ſuffer patiently admonition: yea doth uſe the ſtaffe wherby he ought to have tryed the way, againſt him that sheweth him of the danger. Yet thou art to be admonished <hi>o miſerable An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gell,</hi> howe froward and angry ſoever thou ſhalt be: it may come to paſſe, that at length thou mayſt ſee, and be wiſe: if not, at leaſt wiſe I may be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout danger of ſetting a ſtumbling blocke before the blinde, if I have ſeen the pitte and not shewed it him. And that I may deale with thee more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, I will make thy ſelfe iudge, whether thou be better ſighted then I accuſe thee: although this be unreaſonable in ons owne cauſe, wherein
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:6819:67"/> thou muſt needes be twice blinde. Call therfore to remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with mee, your laſt conſtitutions, which are wont to be wiſeſt, handled in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation at London, and published in the yeare 1597. what medecine doſt thou make for the Church being ſicke? Firſt thou decreeſt that <hi>fitte men be admitted unto Eccleſiaſticall holy orders and benefices, as they call them.</hi> The title in deede recreated many, and very many did iudge thee nowe at length to uſe thine eyes. This kinde of men hath made the Church ſad a great while. There was hope of remedy when thou shouldſt ſee and acknowledge the diſeaſe: For of evell manners doe aryſe good lawes. But howe wiſely haſt thou met with this evill, and ſatiſfyed mens expectation, wey well with thy ſelfe, after give ſentence. Thou knoweſt that it was ordained in a <hi>ſtatute of the Realme, that none ſhould be admitted unto holy orders, but he that ſhould be foure and twenty yeere olde at leaſt, and have brought before the Dioceſan the teſtimony of ſuch men as the Biſhop knoweth to be of ſounde religion, both of his honeſt life, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of his profeſſing the doctrine of our Church; yea have ben able to render a reaſon of his faith in the latine tongue: or at the leaſt hath ben endued with ſome ſpeciall gifte of preaching.</hi> Although this were long agoe enacted, the Church hath ben greatly troubled with a newe rable of moſt unworthy men. With what cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions then haſt thou helped the imbecility of the lawe? For wiſe and quick ſighted men are wont, when they have perceived the weaknes of the lawe, to helpe with more sharpe lawes for that point, wherby they ſee the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of men to breake through. Thou in deede haſt eſtablished manie things, but I pray, what ſerveth for the worthynes of Miniſters, <hi>That noe man be received to holy orders, unleſſe at the ſame time he ſhall exhibite the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe to ſome benefice then void?</hi> or, <hi>who ſhall not bring a certificate from ſome Church, wherein he may ſerve the cure of ſoules,</hi> that is, <hi>where he may play the Curate under ſome one in reading of prayers: or who hath not ben appointed in ſome College; or at leaſt who is not to be admitted of the ſame Biſhop unto ſome Benefice, or to a Cure.</hi> To what Idiote or any the worſt man may not theſe thinges perteine? But thou proceedeſt and addeſt other thinges as vayne as theſe: <hi>Moreover if he ſhallbe,</hi> ſayeſt thou, <hi>of an other Dioces, unleſſe he ſhall bring dimiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſory letters, be full foure and twenty yeeres olde, and hath taken ſome degree in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity</hi> (which laſt is required onely in men of another Dioces), <hi>finally that holy orders be not given, except on the Lords day, or holy dayes.</hi> Excellent ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in deede, for which the reformed Churches may be ashamed. What doe theſe thinges profit at all, that a fit man be admitted? What that after should be ordayned miniſters either more learned or more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt? Wilt thou on the H. Spirit crying by <hi>Paul, who is fit for theſe thinges,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trude a man with a <hi>preſentation,</hi> with a <hi>Certificate,</hi> with <hi>Dimiſſorye letters;</hi> or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6819:68"/> 
                  <hi>who hath ben licenced on the Lords dayes?</hi> But I will not debate the matter har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, onely I appeale to thy conſcience: What I pray have you provided in this matter, who haſt covered the wall ready to fall with ſuch foolish pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring? What touching <hi>plurality of Benefices?</hi> Thou decreeſt that it is to be reſtrayned. And well in deede: for it is an hainous thinge, that one should be a sheapheard of sheepe, which he feedeth not, or at leaſt should receive any fruite from them, which take noe profit from him. It were meete ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, that here thou shouldeſt bring forth whatſoever skill thou haſt, to cure this evill, which not onely the divine oracles, but alſo comon ſenſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demneth of ſacrilege. What remedy then doeſt thou apply? Namely, <hi>Let no man enioy this faculty, unleſſe he be at leaſt a Maſter of Arts, and a publike and fitte preacher of Gods worde:</hi> A notable Phyſician in deede. What have Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Arts deſerved ſo ill at your hands, that thou would have thoſe firſt burdened with ſo great a ſinne? Thou confeſſeſt that <hi>Plurality</hi> is an evill thing, and to be corrected, yet thou permiteſt this miſchiefe to them: In deede it is a notable privilege of their degree, wherby they firſt are licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be evill. But whether thoughteſt thou that the deſtruction by theſe meanes would ſlay more ſecretly? There are ſo many, thankes be to God, as if all, letted by no other religion, should uſe of the liberty of thy conſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tution, more parishes, I beleeve, should want <hi>Paſtours</hi> reſident with them, then at this day they wante. So thou doeſt ſtay and repreſſe prudently the evill by augmenting of it. But peradventure it is enough for thee to decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve men onely with a title and pretence of repreſsing plurality. Moreover there is an ordinance made touching <hi>hoſpitality in the Benefices cared for.</hi> And this is the calamity of our Church that <hi>the Miniſters doe not feede the poore with beefe.</hi> That of <hi>binding the Regulars to make ſermons in their owne proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> would ſeeme to belonge to a sharper ſight, unleſſe peradventure it should call them away from other places, where their labour is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; <hi>I let paſſe the Matrimoniall ordinances.</hi> That is worthy remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>touching exceſſe about Excommunication to be reformed.</hi> For thou ſeeſt it to be defiled shamefully with many pollutions: I would to God thou wouldeſt ſee and regarde as well thoſe thinges, which belong to the holy and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reforming of it. But why doeſt thou firſt deny, <hi>that herein any thing can be inovated or altered without a great mutation to the whole Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, and of very many lawes of this Realme;</hi> yet afterward thou wouldeſt <hi>reduce the ſame to his auncient honour and dignity?</hi> Wouldeſt thou make a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without an alteration? Thou wilt have nothing to be changed, that the lawes may not be violated, yet thou pretendeſt to recall the former comelines. It pittieſt mee that thou canſt not ſee thyne owne blindenes.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:6819:68"/> But by this proviſion thou haſt openly shewed what reformation wee muſt expect, ſuch indeede by which <hi>noe amending</hi> maye be made. Therefore the Title might had ben enough for this thing. Yet that thou mighteſt ſeeme to doe that which thou doeſt not at all, thou uſeſt a certen forme of ordinances. For let us ſee howe they anſwere and agree to the promiſe. Firſt thou ordaineſt, <hi>That in grievous crimes, the ſentence be pronounced, either by the Archbiſhop, Biſhop, Deane, Archdeacon, or Prebendary, in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> What is this auncient uſe of prononcing the ſentence by them, whoſe names, except onely the Bishop, had not ben heard in deede in the Church, as long as the true honour and dignity of excommunication re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned? Why is there noe place left for the Paſtour of every congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to whom once it belonged to pronounce the ſentence? Peradventure it makes noe matter to him what is done to his sheepe, or it maye be that he is not fit, nor endued with iudgement and wiſdome enough. In very deede this fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e might peradventure have prevayled ſome what in time paſt: But nowe it ought not, ſeeing thou haſt ſet us free enough from it in the firſt booke of <hi>the Decrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it is not to be doubted, but that he that hath ben furnished with <hi>Preſentation, Certificate</hi> and the other things, with which thou haſt in the ſame place inſtructed him, should be fit enough and more then fit unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very parte of his office. Or if I muſt deale with thee in earneſt, what let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the <hi>Paſtour</hi> uſing the counſell of others, and making diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, may not pronounce the ſentence, as well, as either the <hi>Biſhop or Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bendary,</hi> or any other? But thou wilt ſay, wee will not have this matter to be handled by common adviſe, but to ſtande to the iudgement of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Is this the meaning of thy reformation, and yet dareſt thou make mention of the honour and dignity of the auncient uſe?</p>
               <p>Chriſt commaunded to <hi>tell the Church:</hi> Shall any one ſuſteyne the place of this Church? One in deede for order ſake did pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence, but the matter was iudged not by his ſentence onely, but by the adviſe of the whole aſſemblie and Councill. Neither would <hi>PAVLE have the Jnceſtuous man to be excommunicated, but when the brethren were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered togither, and conſented,</hi> as wee reade in the firſt Epiſtle of the Corinthes, chapter five, verſe fourth. And ſo the Church for ſome ages after, as is cleare from <hi>Origene, Tertullian, Cyprian</hi> and others. Wherfore I woulde mervayle that thou doeſt promiſe ſo boldly concerning the former and an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient dignity, but that I knew that blinde men feare not the faces of men. But what if this thyne amending which thou pretendeſt doth lay open a way to impunity of grievous crimes?</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:6819:69"/>
               <p>The Commiſſary as long as it perteined to him, twice at leaſt every yeere did compell the Church Warde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s by vertu of an othe, that they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wicked men: Nowe while he should doe that, there is noe cauſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, when the Prieſt aſſociated with him cannot denounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt ſuch man. And in deede it is not to be hoped for, that the Church Wardens willingly will flee unto the <hi>Biſhops, Archdeacons</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaryes,</hi> whom they knowe not where they may finde, or who peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are farre of from them, and a iourney cannot be made without char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when being preſent, and that at other mens coſts, they can ſcarce be driven by othe to bewray the guilty. Thou oughteſt to have minded theſe things, and not to have uſed a remedy worſe then the diſeaſe it ſelfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly thou ſpeakeſt of Excommunication for contumacy, which hath noe newe thinge from thy former decrees. But the repeating of the old manner, is with thee a reformation, leaſt peradventure any boxe should want a ſuperſcription, although there be nothing in it. I paſſe by the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Penance, the foule things of the Officials, the exceſſe of Apparitors</hi> (of taking away who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you ought rather to have intreated, then of moderating them) <hi>and Regiſters.</hi> Thou thy ſelfe howe mayeſt ſpeake howe well thou haſt uſed thyne eyes, who paſsing by many great evills, eyther art wholy occupyed about tryfles: or if peradventure thou haſt touched any weygty matters, thou makeſt them either worſe by curing, or in deede nothing better. Certenly by many reaſons thy blindneſſe is proved. But Chriſt open thyne eyes: I will not ſo much deale with thee by wordes, as for thee by prayers. For I have not purpoſed the handling, but onely the iudging of theſe things. The third part of the diſeaſe is <hi>nakedneſſe:</hi> garments are uſed that wee may provide for shamefulnes. Out of which when one is put, his igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miny is ſet openly in the ſight of men, according to that of the Prophete, <hi>Beholde I am againſt thee, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, and will uncover thy skirts, unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them upon thy face, that J may ſhewe thy nakedneſſe to the nations, and to the Kingdomes thy nakednes,</hi> Nah. 3.5. Therefore this nakedneſſe is a reproch, dishonnour and contempt, whereof this <hi>Angell</hi> is ſicke. For it cannot be that our <hi>Clergy</hi> should not be contemned of men, who manifeſtly &amp; cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe ſee howe beggerly Eccleſiaſticall ſtipends are ſought and deſyred: howe filthily and negligently the holy offices are adminiſtred: howe all care of the flocke is naught ſet by, &amp; the ſtudy of Gods glory is caſt away. When I ſay men ſee theſe thinges, can it be that they should not deſpiſe the <hi>Angell</hi> ſeeking onely his owne things, not thoſe which are Chriſts. And the Angell himſelfe at certen times ſeeth the ſame thing in ſome ſorte, as can teſtify the often complaintes of their publike ſermons, although he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6819:69"/> knoweth not the cauſe, or he would not knowe it, fearing more, as it were, the remedy then the diſeaſe. But it appeareth plainly, howe greatly he is deſpiſed, from that which happened a fewe yeares ſince. A certen man ſet forth bookes, who called himſelfe <hi>a Marrer of Prelates</hi> in which he dealt boldly with the Angell, Howe acceptable to the people were thoſe merry conceites in wordes? Howe plauſible almoſt to all men? Howe gladly and greedily, and with howe great pleaſure were they received every where? Noe man is ſo ignorant and unskilfull in thinges, but that minding the time, he may ſay thus with himſelfe, <hi>For Iehovah hath poured contempt upon the Princes: thoſe that honour him he honoureth, and the deſpiſers of him ſhalbe made light: he hath made our Prieſts to be abiect to all the people, becauſe they have broken his Covenant.</hi> Theſe things, I ſay, a man conſidering with himſelfe, had not ſwerved from the trueth. For if there had ben any eſtimation of the Angell, men would rather have mourned, then laughed, and delivered thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to the fire, before they would had worneth them with fo often han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling and looking on them. I would not tell thee theſe thinges, unleſſe the Spirit did affirm plainly, that thou doeſt not know thyne own nakednes. That falſe glory wherein thou flouriſheſt, ſuffereth thee not earneſtly either to minde or regarde what men ſpeake and thinke of thee. But learne from hence if thou be wiſe, howe ſervants going before in great number, and having chaines, and a great troupe of ſerving men folloing after, are of no force to drive away contempt, and to deliver from the deſpiſing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people: or if thou canſt not perceive theſe things ſo well in thy ſelfe, beholde the <hi>Papiſts, and the Pope their Prince,</hi> howe doth he nowe ſtincke for his deſert with the greateſt part of men, contemned, naught ſet by, vile and hated of all the godly: whoſe feete notwithſtanding ſome Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bewitched, yet doe kiſſe, and then whom, noe mortall man hath ben in time paſt of more imperiall maieſty. Remember our former Prelates, whoſe riches were greater then thyne, their authority greater, their power more to be feared: yet becauſe the common ſorte of people did ſee them to be meere gluttons, howe did they deryde them? The pride of our <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> was mocked openly. For the honours of this world are figge leaves, or as it were torne and ragged clothes, which cover not the nakednes, but make more deformed through the loupes. Minde theſe things, and be not proude of thy golden feathers, but rather where thou art naked, cover thy ſhame, leaſt through vaine boaſting of the part adorned, thou lye deſpiſed with the common people for thy other deformity. And thus at the length I have opened this rotten ſore; if my paines &amp; travaile ſhalbe acceptable, and if being cleanſed it doth farre well, howe great thankes ſhall I give to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:6819:70"/> our God? but if the evill onely ſhalbe ſtirred up and provoked, and the handling ſhall diſquiet them that are ſicke: I will conforte my ſelfe with the conſcience of duty, and the uſuall wages of the Phyſitian.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>I counſell thee to buy of mee Golde:</hi> Hitherto the cauſe, nowe the remedy is taught: both from whence <hi>it is to be fetched,</hi> and <hi>by what meanes,</hi> and alſo what is the <hi>matter</hi> of the medicine it ſelfe. It is to be fetched from Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he alone hath borne all our infirmities, and alone yet can heale our griefes. The way to fetch is by buying: not becauſe he requireth a pryce; for he <hi>ſelleth wine and mylke without mony or chaunging of my thing,</hi> Iſayah 55.1.2. But becauſe he will have a deſire to be brought, even as in getting of things with greate coſt: in which togither alſo he ſheweth the dignity of the remedy, which otherwiſe is not deare at any price. The medicine is threefolde, after the manner of the diſeaſe, which wee have ſhewed to be threefold, <hi>Golde, white garments, and eye ſalve: Golde</hi> is ſet againſt poverty: <hi>white garments</hi> doe cover <hi>nakedneſſe;</hi> and <hi>eye ſalve</hi> doth helpe <hi>againſt blindnes.</hi> Wee have ſayd that <hi>wretchednes and miſery</hi> were accidents, which forthwith vaniſh, when their fountaynes are taken away. Of what ſorte every one of them is, may eaſily be underſtood by their contraryes. Golde is oppoſed <hi>to the riches and poverty of the Angell,</hi> that is, <hi>to the hegging of Benefices and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Offices.</hi> For the former riches are not true, and doe not let but that the Angell may be the moſt baſe and vile begger. But the Golde of Chriſt driveth farre off this beggery. It is therefore that moſt holy manner appointed by Chriſt himſelfe, of calling, chuſing, ordayning, &amp; appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Eccleſiaſticall men, every one to his office. Wherby <hi>Paſtors</hi> doe not ſeeke for the office, but are ſought for: are not promoted for a peace of money, but for goodnes and vertue, not for favour, but learning, not at the will and pleaſure of any man, but by the election and conſent of his flocke. Chriſt will have this Golde to be bought of him, becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath deſcribed playnly this whole way, end hath not left it free to men to deale in this matter at their pleaſure. As long as the thing ſhalbe in the power of one Patrone and Bishop, there will never be wanting bribe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſuch as will ſuffer themſelves to be corrupted with rewardes. But if Chriſt rule be kept, this begging poverty would flee away never to returne againe. For this golde is tryed in the fyre, proved often times &amp; wholy fined. Wee ſee the excellency of it in the primtive Church, &amp; alſo a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monge our neighbours at this day. It dreadeth not any touch ſtone, it fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not any fyre, it burſteth nor aſunder by any knocking of the hammer, but it abode invincible in time paſt, &amp; yet doth abide, with the great glory of them that are made rich therby. <hi>Whyte apparell</hi> is oppoſed to the former
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:6819:70"/> honours &amp; <hi>nakednes,</hi> that is, <hi>contempt.</hi> Theſe garments alſo Chriſts will have to be bought of him, having them moſt pretious &amp; moſt prayſe worthy. For what conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt can come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their worthynes hath choſen, their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ordained, their holines put in authority? Whom many have earneſtly deſired for their tryed godlines, doe admire for their dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in teaching, doe feare becauſe of the moſt free truth, &amp; reverence as exemples of all vertue &amp; honeſty? <hi>Be an exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>to the faithfull, in ſpeach, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſation, in love, in ſpirit, in faith, in chaſtity, let no man deſpiſe thy youth,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.12. Behold the way to deliver from conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt. Theſe garments are full of maieſty, with which youth being covered, is not deſpiſed. And ſo once the <hi>Prophets</hi> wente ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whoſe hairy garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had more eſtimation with all men, then the ſilke &amp; vaine painting of others. Thoſe wicked men &amp; skornes of the Prophets, who were togither with Iehu, when the Prophet having entred in, did lead him out from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, unwares did ſhew what good opinion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet they had fixed in their mindes. <hi>What,</hi> ſay they, <hi>would that made man have with thee?</hi> Yee rather, why doe yee made men aske what that made man would have? But their tongue ſpake according to their wicked cuſtome: their deſyre to knowe did ſhewe aboundantly what authority &amp; credit they gave to him ſecretly; whereupon when the meſſage was knowne aſſuredly, they created him King whom the made man had annointed for King. The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> with his leather girdle &amp; garment of Camels haire was ſafe from the iniury of the Prieſts, becauſe of the honour, wherewith the comon people honoured him. The ſtrenght of the divine inſtitution is great, in which God himſelfe getteth authority, eyther by the voluntary obedience of men, or by ſome punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inflicted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. There is no neede of the shewe of earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly riches &amp; honours, which at the firſt is wont to dazell the eyes of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull, but at lenght when the vanity of it is perceived, it is no leſſe deſpiſed them frogges fallen from the ayre. Therefore garments are to be bought of Chr. by which alone our nakednes is covered, appearing otherwiſe very de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formed, whatſoever clothes thou putteſt upon it. <hi>Eye ſalve</hi> of old was all kinde of medicine, made in that manner, that is might be kept while neede should require. At lenght the name remayned chiefly in thoſe, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared for the diſeaſes of the eyes: becauſe the Phyſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s have uſed abonda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of it. Here it is applyed againſt the blindnes, namely the wiſdome of the flesh, &amp; ignorance of ſpirituall things. Wee reade that a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſenſible thing was made of the ſpittle of Chr. &amp; of earth, Io. 9.6. as it were by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt by the word that proceedeth out of his mouth, &amp; alſo the knowledge of our ſelves, who made in the beginning, of the earth, ſavour nothing but the earth. Both theſe are to be ioined togither &amp; to be knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into one lumpe, they profit nothing aſunder,</p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:6819:71"/>
               <p>For our miſery being knowne particularly, bringeth forth deſperation; &amp; Chriſt being receaved without the feeling of our owne unworthynes, is un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>profitable and unfruictfull.

Firſt therefore wee muſt remove our owne wiſdome, which as longe as it reigneth, doth poſſeſſe us ſo wholy, that it leaveth noe place for true and heavenly. For o <hi>Angell,</hi> wouldeſt thou have deviſed a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation taken wholy our of thyne owne braine, unleſſe thou hadſt ſwelled full of the opinion of thyne owne wiſdome?

After what exemple of the purer Church, are our matters being fallen downe, corrected and amended? There is a deepe ſilence of all theſe things; noe where is heard, either <hi>Paul,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſes of the holy trueth, upon whoſe credit the things eſtabliſhed might reſt and ſtay themſelves. I beleeve thou ſhalt ſcarce finde a <hi>Synode,</hi> even in the corrupteſt times, in which the divine authority is more dumbe and ſpeechleſſe. This opinion is to be layd away o <hi>Angell,</hi> thou muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that thou art earth, and that thou haſt noe eye ſalve in thee, tyll thou ſhalt be mollified with the heavenly ſpittell, and ſubdued into a linamente. Depende therefore on the <hi>mouth of Chriſt,</hi> from whence flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that which is profitable to <hi>doctrine, to confutation, to correction, to inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in righteouſnes, that the man of God may be perfite, to every good worke,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16.17. From hence is conpounded that eye ſalve, which will take away the skales of the eyes, &amp; endue thee with that ſharpnes of ſight, that thou mayeſt ſee playnly, <hi>how thou oughteſt to behave thy ſelfe in the houſe of God.</hi> Neither muſt thou give eare to them, who not onely unskilfully, but alſo ungodly cry out, that the rules of theſe things are not to be fetched from this ſhop. Chriſt would not ſeth forth himſelfe to be a ſeller of eye ſalve, unleſſe he had it both aboundantly, wherby he might healpe our wante, and alſo it were not lawfull to buy it from any other. So then the medicine is threefould, <hi>Golde</hi> againſt poverty, which earthly riches eaſe not: <hi>white raiment</hi> againſt nakednes, which the honours of the world hide not: <hi>Eye ſalve</hi> againſt blindnes, which the wiſdome of the fleſh taketh not away. From which nowe at length it may be underſtood, that thoſe riches where of in the former verſe the Angell boaſted is not the righteouſnes of faith alone, as the counterfait <hi>Ambroſe</hi> prateth unwiſely. For thoſe riches reſted not on Chriſt alone. Whereupon he warneth that he would buy gold of him, which he ſhould doe in vaine, if before the Angell did aboun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:6819:71"/> in the ſame. But the righteouſnes of faith hath all his treaſures placed in Chriſt alone; of which he is made partaker, whoſoever beleeveth truly, and renounceth all other righteouſnes, Iohn 6.48. Rom. 3.7. Therefore o <hi>Ribera,</hi> drawe rather water out of a pumeiſe ſtone, then overthrowe the righteouſnes of faith from this place. But ſuch trifles of thyne doe fall of themſelves downe, that I neede not ſpend time in confuting of them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>As many as I love &amp;c.</hi> An exhortation to uſe the remedy: and firſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chaſtiſing of them whom he loveth.

Whoſoever is either among ſonnes, or amonge the reprobate: Yf he receiveth noe ſonne, whom he rebuketh and chaſteneth not, what ſhall be done with the multitude of the reſt? An horrible deſtruction remaineth for them, whom he will ſpare never ſo little, who doe not ſuffer his owne children to eſcape uncorrected. Therefore a chaſtiſement is at hande, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou repent betime, and that very grievous and full of trouble, as the very wordes themſelves doe ſhew: which are wont to be uſed for a confort in a bitter affliction, wherewith the minde is ſo ſtricken as if it were forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God. Therefore he ſaith they are ſonnes, whom he beateth with ſo cruell puniſhements, leaſt through the grievouſnes of the puniſhement, they ſhould deſpayre of his fatherly goodnes. Therefore it is not time nowe to ſtrive and to contend with mutuall hatred and reproches, but the eares are to be lift up to the alarme of Chriſt, and wee muſt either thinke forthwith of the remedy, or ſome great and lamentable calamity is to be expected ſhortly. And it is to be obſerved that he doth <hi>rebuke and chaſten;</hi> that is, convince and puniſh. Theſe two thinges are to be ioyned togither. Puniſhement is unprofitable where wordes are ſilent, ſtripes are fierce. From whence chaſtiſement is well called diſcipline, wherein the offender feeleth paine and learneth togither. But what ſhall then be the fruict of ſo longe and ſpitefull contention, when the convinced and chaſtiſed ſonne shalbe compelled, will, he, nil he, to ſinge a contrary ſonge? Were it not better to give now eare to learne, then to expect that ſorowfull chaunging of our iudgement? Although Chriſt in deede hath convinced already, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nowe by the ſpace of many yeeres, many notable men doe labour in this thing, that the brethren may underſtand the trueth. What remaineth now, but that at length he fetch out his roddes and chaſtiſe thoſe whom he hath rebuked ſo longe time without fruict.</p>

                  <hi>in one ſermon three thouſand were converted,</hi> Act. 2.41. Neither is it at this day of it ſelfe leſſe mighty: yet there is a diverſe raiſon of a Church to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; one gatthered. God ſheweth himſelfe extraordinarily bountifull in inviting his people, which after he hath gathered togither, he will have them to grow by the way appointed. As touching the fruit of the Goſpell therefore, the people receaveth no leſſe loſſe of ſo excellent an ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angell doth acknowledge himſelfe maimed &amp; lame, being ſpoiled of his lawfull power. This key is wanting to our Church, &amp; therefore it is noe mervayle if Chriſt be hindred that he cannot enter in readily, ſeeing the doo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res are ſhutte. But are wee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtitute of every good thing? in no wiſe, but wee enioy ſtill a double good thing wholſome to the elect: the firſt of which is the going in of Chr. unto thoſe that doe open to him. The 2 is their moſt ſweete ſetting downe with Chriſt. That is the moſt ſweete ſolace of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt, which the Saints perceive, as often as at the word preached they feele their harts to be opened by faith, by the worke of the Spirit. For then he entreth in &amp; ſuppeth with us, in imperting himſelfe moſt beningly and ſweetly: even as he bad Zacheus deſiring to ſee him &amp; clyming up on a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de figge tree, <hi>to come downe &amp; to make ready for him entertainment at his houſe.</hi> Luke 19.5. And he ſuppeth not going awaye ſcotfree, who doth give them that thus embrace him, that they be made the ſonnes of God, Ioh. 1.12. He againe, entertaineth us, that wee maye ſuppe togither with him, as often as with pure mindes wee come to the Sacrament of the Supper, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he feedeth us with his owne fleſh and blood moſt ſumptuous delicious dainties, above all that can be ſpoken or thought.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:6819:73"/>
               <p>In which ſenſe it is ſpoken in Luke chap. 13.29. <hi>Then they ſhall come from the Eaſt and from the Weſt, and from the North, and from the South, and ſhall ſit downe in the kingdome of God,</hi> that is, men ſhall aſſemble togither to the Goſpell from all quarters: ſhall embrace the doctrine of the kingdome, and ſhall be partakers of Chr. truely, whoſe pledges they ſhall take, bread &amp; wine, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe at his table in celebrating his ſacred ſupper. For he ſpeaketh of the calling of the Gentiles, whoſe faith and aſſenting to the whole truth, he ſignifyeth by one ſacramentall action. Theſe gueſts now Chriſt would call, when in the meane tyme the Iewes, of whom he ſpeaketh in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, did abhorre and deſpiſe the way of ſalvation, as wee ſee it hath come to paſſe now for the ſpace of many ages. Wherto pertaineth that which in the ſame place the Iewes excluded doe alleadge, requiring an entry for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves becauſe of their former familiarity in eating &amp; drinking in his ſight; ver. 26. as though they ſhould ſay, O Lord, wee communicating at thy table, have feaſted merrily with thee, in eating of thy ſacrifices, wilt thou locke the doore nowe againſt us? For in this reſpect the meate of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices was the ſame thinge to the Iewes, that the bread and wine is to us. Neither are theſe thinges notwithſtanding ſo to be taken, as though the elect were limited within the boundes of this life; but becauſe the ſupper which is made on earth, is a pledge of the eternall feaſt in the heavens. Theſe thinges therfore proove, that a double and great good thing doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in the Engliſh Church, that is to ſay, the <hi>preaching of the word and the lawfull adminiſtration of the ſacraments.</hi> In both which Chriſt beſtoweth him ſelfe upon hiſpeople, keeping a mutuall feaſt with them, he firſt being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of us by hearing, ſecondly entertaining us againe with the ſupper-of his body. O wee therefore moſt impure as often as wee fly from and forſake hearing of the word, for wee refuſe Chriſt to be our gueſt: O wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deſpiſers that wee are, as often as wee withdrawe our ſelves from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving the ſacrament with our brethren. For wee deſpiſe Chriſt bidding us to ſupper. But theſe thinges are added for the ſingular confort of the godly. For who would not quake and thinke of flying very quickly from this Church, when they ſhould heare that the condition of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> is hated of Chriſt, whom not repenting he will vomit out of his mouth ſhortly, unleſſe by the words of Chriſt himſelfe they were aſſured of their communicating with him? Praiſe be to thee therfore moſt <hi>meecke Lambe,</hi> who finding the dore ſhutte againſt thee, doſt not departe quickly, being moved with anger and fury, and deprive us of all meanes of ſalvation, but leaveſt yet an abondance of thy ſelfe to all that doe open to thee knocking by the word, and deſpiſe not thy moſt ſweete inviting by the Sacrements.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6819:73"/> Therefore wicked and blaſpehmous is their errour who doe fall away ſo from this Church, aa if Chriſt were baniſhed wholy from hence, and that there could be no hope of ſalvation for them that tarry there. Let them minde here <hi>Chriſt</hi> feaſting with his people. Will they be aſhamed to ſit downe there, where they ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> not be aſhamed? Are they holier &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then hee? But why doe they not convince themſelves, by their owne ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perience? They cannot deny, but that they beleeved in Chriſt before they made a ſeparation from us: whence came this faith? Cam it not from our preaching in our Church? Can any then preach except he be ſent? Rom. 10 13. &amp;c. Why then doe they ſo perverſly refuſe, for ſome blemiſh in the outward calling, that worde, whoſe divine force they feele in their harts? Althoug the fruict it ſelfe doth noe more free from blame our cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruptions, then a true childe, adultery. And therefore, neither may wee ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take pleaſure in them, nor they forſake and fall away from us for ſome blemiſhes; Wherefore returne to the unity of the Church, which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and nouriſhed you. Yf you fly from this Chriſt, who ſuppeth with is elect in our aſſemblyes, and welcometh them againe, yee ſhall finde him no were. In the meane time let us alſo minde how great evill wee call for upon our ſelves, who by holding hard our ſuperſtitions, doe throwe our brethren into ſo great danger. Certenly if that hath any weight, which the truth himſelfe once confirmed, <hi>it were better for ſuch men, that a milſtone being hanged about their necks, they were drowned in to bottome of the ſea,</hi> Mat. 18 6. I wiſh health of minde to both. But more over this place is to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the fraude of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who will have it to be in the power of men to open to <hi>Chriſt</hi> knocking. <hi>Whether,</hi> ſaith Bellarmine, <hi>doth he not know, that they cannot open? Should he not be a foole, who would knocke at the doore of his niggbour, if he knewe certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly that none were within, who could ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> in his firſt book of grace and free will, chap. 11. I anſwere, he ſhould not without cauſe be a foole, if his onely end of knocking were, that he mitght enter in: But Chriſt knocketh at the doore of the reprobates, whom he knoweth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be willing, nor able to open, not that he may enter in, but partly that he may upbride the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with their impotency gotten by their owne fault: partly that he may encreaſe their condemnation. For ſo ſpeaketh the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt expreſſely, <hi>Therfore they could not beleeve</hi> Iohn. 12.34. Why then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he wordes to them, who have not ability to beleeve? <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe ſheweth: <hi>If I had not come,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſpoken unto them, they ſhould not have had ſinne, but now they have no cloke for their ſinne,</hi> Ioh. 15.22. Therefore he ſpake unto them, that for the contempt and hatred of his onely begotten ſonne, their condemnation migh be the greater. Such are the powers of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6819:74"/> the naturall man, as is the love of the trueth in the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who ſeeing it, refuſe it wickedly.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>To him that overcometh J will give to ſit,</hi> word for word in the Greeke is, <hi>He that overcometh I will give him,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>I will give to the overcomer;</hi> by the nominative caſe abſolute, as was obſerved before chap. 2.26. This third reaſon is taken from the reward of being a companion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his throne: Not becauſe the glory of every one of the children ſhalbe equall to the honour of the <hi>Man Chriſt:</hi> but becauſe the glory &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of the head, ſhall redounde to every one of the membres. Therefore the thrones are not peculiar to the <hi>twelve Apoſtles</hi> of which ſee Mat. 19.28. but common to all the elect. Althoug in a certen peculiar manner they are attributed in the ſame place to the Apoſtles, as it may be wee will ſhewe in an other place. And wee have ſayd often that the rewards are fitted unto the times, and to contayne a Propheſy, which is here alſo to be reſpected. Chriſt therfore mentioneth the throne which he obtayned, after his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice finiſhed on the croſſe: shewing that the like thinges are to be endured alſo of his, afterward they shalbe partakers of his throne. Therefore by this making mention of it, he leſſeneth the affliction, and ſo the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it he ſetteth himſelfe for an example, as though he should bidde us looke upon him, and not to be overcome of any troubles, when wee ſee that he aſcended into his throne of ſupreme dignity by this way. And wee knowe how much this contending for reformation hath coſt many &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men, whoſe ſufferings shall not be forgotten, although they be not recited of mee. Onely let them confort their faintnes of heart with the expectation of his throne. What thoug they be trode under foote, while they shall ſee others to flouriſh with the dignity of <hi>Peeres of the Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me?</hi> Chriſt hath prepared for them a throne with himſelfe. Let noe man regarde an earthly chayre: as hitherto they have confirmed abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that they are farre of from ſuch deſire, whatſoever ambitious men prate other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who doe coniecture of other by themſelves.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>Let him that hath an eare heare:</hi> Nowe therefore thou whoſoever haſt felt Chriſt to be thy gueſt, &amp; haſt taſted agayne of the daintyes of his table, left up thyne eates &amp; atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the thing which the Spirit ſaith to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Let man goe, &amp; reſt not in him, but regarde the conveniency of all things from the beginning to the end. And complaine not of the newnes &amp; ſtrangenes, as though thou wouldeſt appoint Chriſt, to whom &amp; when he should reveale his ſecrets. Wee know that ſomethings have bin ſealed up unto the determined time. But if it be needfull, that thou confeſſe it to be a divine truth, let us all endevoure earneſtly, Princes, Peeres, Angels
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:6819:74"/> people, that wee may turne away the evill that hangeth over our heades. What an horrible thing is it to be vomited out of the mouth of Chriſt with loathing and abhorring? The land vomited our once the Chananites, and they were deſtroyed utterly. Shall their puniſhement be lighter, whom not the land, but Chriſt himſelfe ſhall ſpue out? Therefore let us uſe the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeriouſly. Wee have neede of zeale, wherby wee may attayne a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: Wee hang yet betweene Heaven and Hell: The contagious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of the Romiſh marſh doth moleſt and annoy us; our ſylver hitherto is foule with droſſe: our wine is mixt with water: Chriſt will ſuffer no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſuch Angels that are in the middle? What if this myne admonition be the laſt token and ſigne to thee of bewarring? Let us therfore give eare, &amp; not whet our teeth againſt the ſtone that is hurled: But let us quake for feare of the hande that threwe it. Thou o Chriſt, who tookeſt lingring Lot by the hande to pull him out of the city, open our hearts who are ſlow and prolonge the tyme, that wee may obey thy warnings and exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>

               <p>HITHERTO hath ben the Propheſy of particular Churches: that of the whole Church followeth; which propoundeth firſt the matter ſummarily in this chapter: afterward ſpecially in the reſt of the chapters. This conteineth a new calling of Iohn, conſiſting in the thing ſeen, <hi>a doore open in heaven,</hi> in the firſt voice heard of <hi>a trumpet,</hi> ver. 1, and laſtly in the effect, wherby <hi>he was in the Spirit</hi> forthwith, in the beginning of the ſecond verſe: and alſo the univerſall type of the future Church, which is deſcribed in the reſt of the whole chapter. Whoſe Prince as it were the centre, is moſt glorious by the <hi>Throne,</hi> moſt delectable in <hi>ſight,</hi> ſhining with heavenly brightnes rounde about, ver. 2.3. The membres of this centre, as it were the circunference, are the <hi>foure and twenty Elders,</hi> full of maieſty, reverend in their ſeates, age, holynes, and crownes of golde, ver. 4. The things acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying theſe perſons, are partly giftes, which God hath beſtowed on the holy congregation; partly the worſhip it ſelfe, which the congregation of the faithfull doth yeelde unto him. The gifts are firſt of <hi>protection:</hi> wherby proceede from the throne lightnings, thunders, and voices, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the wicked world, becauſe of their entrepriſes againſt the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſaints, ver. 5. Secondly, of ſanctification, wherby <hi>he preſenteth</hi> the holy congregation <hi>blameſſe before him, not having ſpot or wrinkle,</hi> or any ſuch thing, of theſe the interne are <hi>the ſeaven lampes burning before the throne,</hi> ver. 5.

                  <hi>Afterward J ſaw;</hi> Thoſe things being declared which are of ſome ſhort time, nowe the Spirit, thoſe boundes being enlarged, purſueth with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued order, thoſe thinges which ſhould ſhewe the comon and entyre fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of things from the time of this writing unto the laſt ende. The handling of which things wilbe admirable, neither wilbe accompliſhed and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without his ayde alone, which ſhewed theſe thinges firſt to his ſervant. Truſting therefore to his grace, I will proceed in the worke begun. Vnto the finishing whereof, howſoever other things ſhalbe wanting, certenly faithfulnes and diligence in ſearching out to my power, ſhall not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Theſe firſt wordes are perteining to a newe preparation, unto a newe propheſy. For Iohn is noe more converſant on the earth, but is taken up into heaven, where through a doore opened he beholdeth wonderfull changes of things that were to be knowne by noe other way. Therfore the manner of the Propheſy following is divers from the former. That former is ſtraighter, even as alſo the place where it was ſeen, a ſmall Iland compaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed with the ſea: this ſpred farre and neere paſſing all meaſure, even as alſo the heaven it ſelfe containing all things within his compaſſe. Furthermore a certen viſible print and ſigne of thinges to come was there to be ſeene in thoſe ſeaven cityes. For the Churches that after were to be inlarged &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſhould be pourtrayed and drawne out by the will of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent image and figure of them, but there was noe token or ſhew among mortall men of the things to be ſpoken of in this ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy. For the peculiar iudgements, of which there is moſt ſpeach here, are to be fetched from that ſecret revelation alone. Vnto the heaven then, where liberty of this viſion was given, is added afterward the booke ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſeaven ſeales: then noe creature ſufficient to open the ſame: nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſufficient power of any one, except of the Lambe onely, as wee ſhall ſee
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:6819:76"/> in his place. All which things, as they declare the excellency of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, ſo they require our greater attention and earneſt bending of our mindes to them. As touching the wordes, <hi>the firſt voice is heard,</hi> becauſe there is the ſame author of both Prophecies: and <hi>ſoundeth like a trumpet,</hi> wherby the thinges heard may be made more certen and out of doubte, &amp; might be perceived the better of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as hath ben obſerved at chap. 1.10. It biddeth to <hi>come up hither,</hi> where onely the things might be ſeene, of which there was noe tracke or path made in the earth. And he would not that he ſhould ſee a farre of as through the doore, by which meanes he might be deceaved, or not ſee the thinge playnely enough, but that he ſhould be preſent and before him, that he might have a certen &amp; undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge of the things. But that which followeth is not voyde of doubting, howe he may ſay, that he will ſhewe a viſion of things which muſt be done <hi>after theſe.</hi> For whether ſhould the following Propheſy not take her beginning, before that former of the ſeaven Churches ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne his ende? But in them wee ſee is intreated of thinges of our time: or if wee reſpect the bare types, many thinges to come were fore ſhewed; moreover in thoſe thinges that followe it ſhall noe leſſe appeare that <hi>Iohn-</hi> doth tell of things agreeing with their owne times: ſo that the wordes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo underſtood by any meanes. Wherfore neither is that diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on firme, wherein the whole Prophecy is diſtinguiſhed into thinges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future. The Spirit followeth not ſuch diſtribution, but mixeth many future thinges with preſent as they are counted. Wherfore theſe wordes, <hi>after theſe thinges,</hi> are not refferred, in reſpect of their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to the end of the former prophecy, but unto the preſent age of <hi>Iohn,</hi> yea unto that very moment, wherin the Spirit revealed theſe thinges: from whence a newe beginning be in taken, he deſcribeth the continuall courſe and terme of time of the whole Church, and annexeth thoſe things which could not be underſtood ſufficiently from the former types. Therefore Theod. Beza well tranſlated <hi>heta tauta</hi> by and adverbe <hi>hereafter.</hi> But in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the end, not without cauſe this ſecond Prophecy, is counted after the former, as being of a farre longer time, reaching unto the laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, wheras that former is termined with farre narrower boundes. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe things therfore there are, as wee take it, two things chiefly to be obſerved: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that from this place thoſe things onely are handled, which doe follow the tyme of the revelation made. For ſo he ſpeaketh playnely, <hi>And J will ſhew thee the thinges, that muſt be done hereafter.</hi> Which being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of certen Interpreters, I mervayle was not obſerved in their expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But the times through the whole treatiſe to be confounded ſo by a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6819:76"/> whirlewinde, that all thinges were wrapped in moſt thicke darcknes. Wee being taught by their exemple, wee will borowe light from hence for the expoſition following. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> that this Propheſy belongeth to the whole Church, which is neither tyed to any particular Churches, nor is en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded with any other boundes, then the whole frame of the world. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſet in the firſt place, that particular Propheſy, that he might relate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thinges commonly, without interrupting of the narration.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Therfore I was ſuddenly raviſhed in the Spirit:</hi> Here is the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority altogither, which was before, as well from the perſon calling, as from the perſone called. For it is the ſame holy inſpiration of God, which he mentioned in the firſt chapter verſe 10. But what neede was there of a newe inſpiration? Had the former ceaſed, that in a certen diſtance of time it might be kindled a freſh? Without doubt the inſtinction was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all without intermiſſion: but he ſaith that it was ſuddenly in the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit did frame him to receave newe viſions, unto which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived himſelfe prepared forthwith. The whole Revelation ſeemeth to have ben finiſhed in that one Lords day, chap, 1.10. and therefore that there fell out noe intermiſſion after that it began once to be exhibited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And beholde a Throne was placed in heaven:</hi> Such was the preparation by a newe calling: now he cometh to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon type of the holy Church. The deſcription of which was neceſſary before he ſhould enter into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Propheſy. For when as her manifolde dangers and notable alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were to be rehearſed, her flight, returne, falſe friends, open enemys, cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait Soſiae, who ſhould vaunt themſelves under the ſhewe of her, and many other things of that ſorte were to be declared, with which ſhee ſhould contende and have to doe, it was needfull, that firſt a certen forme and image of her ſhould be pourtrayed, which is the principall point of the treatiſe following, leſt peradventure in ſo great ſturres and troubles, wee ſhould ſuppoſe her to have ben wholy extinguiſhed and abolished, or at leaſt wiſe her face being not knowne, wee should be the more hindred from acknowledging of her.</p>
               <p>Werfore wee shall finde this Type to be common to all ages, as of which there is mention made in the fourteene chapter of this booke and thirde verſe. Where <hi>the companions and followers of the Lambe ſing a newe ſonge before the foure Beaſts and the Elders.</hi> And againe nearer to the ending of the Propheſy, <hi>the foure and twenty Elders and the foure Beaſts fall downe and worſhip God,</hi> as may be ſeene in the nineteene chapter of this booke and in the fourth verſe.</p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:6819:77"/>
               <p>So in other places, as ſpeach is made of the true Church, ſo farre as any thing is to be done in the publike aſſembly, ſhee is noted alwayes after the manner of this type. For wee may not thinke that any congregation on earth is to be found of ſo abſolute purity and ſounde perfection, as is here deſcribed, but that all the holy aſſemblyes of the elect, are counted ſuch in Chriſt, before God the Father, although much terrene dregges be ſprinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keld upon them, according to that, <hi>The Church to be ſanctifyed by Chriſt, &amp; to be purged by the waſhing of water through the word, made alſo glorious, without ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but to be holy and without blame,</hi> Epheſ. 5.26.27. An exemple of which deſcription wee have here ſet before our eyes. And for that purpoſe beſides, that wee ſhould conforme all our aſſemblyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this rule: even as Moſes was commaunded <hi>to make the frame of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and all his implements, altogither as was ſhewed to him in the mount,</hi> Exod. 25.9. But the type of our Church is ſhewed in the very heavens, according to the more plentifull glory, wherewith the Goſpell ſhyneth above the Lawe: But howe much the more diligently all things are to be conſidered Seeing therfore wee knowe the drift of the viſion, let us ſearch out the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſeverall things. Firſt, <hi>the head</hi> it ſelfe <hi>of the Church</hi> is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ſuch as the true members doe alwayes confeſſe and worſhippe; both by his <hi>ſitting</hi> in a <hi>Throne</hi> in this verſe, and alſo by the ſimilitude following. The <hi>ſitting</hi> declareth the maieſty and glory of the moſt high God, and noe leſſe his ſteddy and ſtable dwelling among the Saints, in whoſe aſſembly he hath placed his throne of dignity, to goe to noe other place. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but one throne and one that ſitteth on it, wee knowe that God is one in nature, power, maieſty, glory, and that there is not any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſide, who ruleth in the middes of the ſaints. Therfore the holy Church, worſhippeth and prayſeth with all honour and reverence the one onely ſupreme Iehovah.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And he that ſate, was to looke on like:</hi> Aretas, the Complutent edition, and the Kings Bible doe not reade theſe firſt wordes, <hi>and he that ſate was</hi> but they adde by and by to the ende of the former verſe, theſe following wordes, <hi>like in ſight;</hi> Our bookes and the comon latine tranſlation doe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh more playnly the <hi>ſitting</hi> and the ſimilitude; which thing in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the true God, ſeemeth that it ought not to be omitted. This verſe ſheweth a little more fully of what ſorte this one God is; of whom yet it ſet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth forth noe image but onely a certen kinde of colour, after thoſe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient repreſentations made once to the olde people. <hi>You ſaw,</hi> ſayth Moſes, <hi>noe ſimilitude in the day that Iehovah ſpake to you in Horeb, out of the middes of the fyre,</hi> Deut. 4.15. For the ſame is that one true God reigning in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6819:77"/> aſſemblyes, whom from the beginning the primitive Church worship<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped. And ſeeing that in the infancy of the Church he shewed noe image of himſelfe, much leſſe is any ſimilitude to be expected in this up growen and ripe age. This is a more familiar &amp; fuller manifeſtation, ſeeing beſide one and the ſame eſſence, which the common glory noteth, the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible diſtinction of the three perſons, is in ſome ſorte revealed by the three pretious ſtones, <hi>the Iaſper, Sardin, and Emerald.</hi> For it pleaſeth the Spirit to uſe the delightfull Iewels to diſcloſe theſe myſteryes, becauſe the grace and beauty of theſe doth moſt of all excell in this world belowe, whereupon they may be moſt fitte images of that pleaſantnes, which exceedeth all crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted underſtanding; eſpecially ſeeing the repreſentation is rather of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue then of any forme. The firſt ſight of the <hi>Iaſper,</hi> reſembleth the perſon of the Father: this Iewell is greene, and not without cauſe called <hi>the mother of Jewels,</hi> the kindes of it are ſo many, and the honour ſo auncient. And what more fitly among pearles could shadowe out the <hi>Father,</hi> who is the firſt in order, alwayes of a flourishing eternity, &amp; of whom the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have their beginning and originall? The ſecond ſight is of the <hi>Sardin,</hi> wherby the <hi>Sonne</hi> is repreſented. This Iewel is redde of a fleshly colour, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo it is called a <hi>Carneole,</hi> fitly in deede being in his ſtead, who tooke upon him flesh for our ſake, and was made a <hi>man,</hi> like unto us. The third ſight is of a rainebowe, of the colour of an Emerald, wherby the <hi>H. Ghoſt</hi> is noted. He compaſſeth the Throne round aboute, as in the booke of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome chap. 9.4. compaſsing the whole circuit of the divine maieſty with an unutterable ſweetnes. For the Emerald doth shewe ſo acceptable, plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſant, and shining greenes, that the eyes beholde nothing more gladly. Yet this Raynebowe is not like that which is comonly ſo called. For this is not over againſt the <hi>Throne,</hi> but about the Throne: neither is it an halfe circle, but whole and full on every ſide. For it is <hi>rounde about the throne:</hi> finally it is not of three colours, as the true Rainebowe, but of one onely and ſimple colour of the Emerald. Such therfore is that God, one in nature, three in perſons, the head and centre of the Church; whome alone the faithfull are in love with, and doe worship, taking pleaſure moſt ſweetly with all their hartes in his incomprehenſible ſweetnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And rounde aboute the Throne:</hi> So is the Head, nowe he adioyneth the body, like the circumference of this centre, as wee have ſayd. Which is deſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cribed by <hi>the place, the number of members, age, apparell and crownes.</hi> The place is double, <hi>common,</hi> about the hygheſt throne, and <hi>proper,</hi> the peculiar thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of every one. The <hi>comon,</hi> rounde about the throne, is before, behinde, at the right hand and at the left, that it may parte the Raine bowe (which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6819:78"/> compaſſed alſo the Throne, but with a contrary ſituation, above, beneath, and on both ſides) at the right corners. Although the Rainebowe ſeemeth not ſo much to be divided or touched, as to be included with this compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Elders: which nevertheleſſe it should cut in the middle, as it were, if it were extended unto a full compaſſe. Vnleſſe peradventure the higheſt throne be ſet in the ſame playne place, in which were the thrones of the Elders; for then the Rainebowe shall not be in a contrary ſeate or ſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuation, but shallbe compaſſed onely with a longer circuite, as the circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferences nigher the centre are wont to be contained in thoſe that are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of. This common ſeate is attributed to them from the manner of the ſaints, who are called his compaſſers, as <hi>vowe and performe to Jehovah your God, yee that ſtand round about him,</hi> Pſal. 76.12. And as Chriſt promiſeth, <hi>that he will be in the middeſt of them that ſhalbe gathered togither in his name.</hi> Mat. 18.20. So in olde time, <hi>the Tabernacle was ſet in the middes of the Jewes cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> Numb. 2. And this is for the confort of the Godly, whom all, God receiveth <hi>without reſpect of perſons, being alike nigh to all that call upon him:</hi> leaſt peradventure any should complaine, that he is dealt with all uniuſtly, as who being ſet in a latter place, hath noe acceſſe unto God, but by meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and mediatours. The proper place is <hi>every ons Throne. For they ſit upon Thrones.</hi> Wherby is ſignifyed that all are of a Kingly dignity; of which an other marke is added in the ende of the verſe, namely the <hi>Crownes.</hi> This honour the ſaints enioy by Chriſt, who hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God and his father, chap. 1.6. Neither doth he adorne with this benefite ſome fewe excellent faithfull ons a part, but receaveth all the elect into the fellowſhip of the ſame honour. Every one knoweth, howe this certen num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of foure and twenty <hi>thrones,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Elders,</hi> tormenteth the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters. Some referre it to the twelve <hi>Patriarches,</hi> or the twelve <hi>Prophetes,</hi> &amp; ſo many <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> But the thing as it ſeemeth is farre from the trueth. For he ſpeaketh of future congregations, not of thoſe that were paſt, as before ver. 1. Then of ſuch, whoſe office is performed on earth, not in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called: as afterward wee ſhall ſee, ch. 14.3. &amp; 15.7. That I may not ſay that they ſwerve wholy from the ſcope of this viſion. Others apply it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way: but it were to longe to recken, much more to confute all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It shalbe ſufficient to propound, that which ſeemeth moſt likely to mee, &amp; to put it to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the godly. The Spirit alludeth to that diſtribution of the holy offices &amp; ſervants of the King, ordayned by David from God into 24 orders, 1 Chr. ch. 24. &amp;c. For firſt <hi>the chiefe Prieſts</hi> were diſtributed into 24 orders. After the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, the chiefe <hi>Levites</hi> that ſerved the Prieſts in the ſame ch. ver. 31. So <hi>the holy Muſicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> ch. 25. &amp; the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6819:78"/> 
                  <hi>Doore keepers,</hi> ch. 26. Of thoſe that ſerved the King 24 thouſandes in their ſeverall diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ch. 27. Therfore ſeeing the whole congregation of the children of Iſraell, whether wee reſpect the tribe of Levi, or the reſt of the people accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted after a ſorte for the Kings lot, whoſe affayres they did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, was diſtinguished into 24 orders: not without cauſe thoſe Elders which are both Prieſts &amp; Kings, &amp; are in ſteade of all the faithfull ſerving Chriſt, are rekoned in ſo many orders &amp; by the ſame number. And togither alſo is shewed by this number of 24, how much larger is the Church of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was that of the Iewes. This was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in 12 Patriarches, as the chiefe heads: that greater by halfe: that is many degrees, which a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meaſure ſignifyeth indefinitly, exceeding ſo in multitude of cityzens, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in clearnes of the things knowne. Whence the neerer they came to the times of Chriſt, ſo much were all things in former time the clearer &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. How cleare made David the ſervice of the Tabernacle, the offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcribed, their place aſsigned to every one.

Infants, although they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy honour through the right of inheritance, becauſe of future hope, yet they want the preſent fruition of things. And in the whole time in deede of the Lawe, the heire was an infant, and differed nothing from a ſervant, brought into bondage under the elements of the world, as under tutours &amp; governours: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the full time came, we ar no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger under a schoole maiſter, but e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioy the liberty of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo as all the faithfull now ar called <hi>Elders</hi> moſt ſigifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, Gal. 3.25. &amp; 4.1.2. &amp;c. <hi>White raime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is the marke of the Prieſt hood,</hi> Ex. 28.40. which office the beleevers in Chriſt doe execute, <hi>giving up their bodyes a living ſacrifice, holy &amp; acceptable to God, that their reaſonable ſervice of God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>The golden crownes of the head,</hi> manifeſt the ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne maieſty of a kingdome.

The punishement of the perſecutours are witneſſes, whoſe rage and fury God hath alwayes punished in this ſort by his ſpeciall providence. Otherwiſe howe could the truth have bin ſpred and extended even unto theſe times, in ſo deadly hatred of the world? But he that ſetteth on the throne doe not permitte any to oppreſſe his ſaincts without punishement, he reproveth alſo <hi>Kings</hi> for their ſakes, ſaying, <hi>touch not myne annointed, and doe my Prophets noe harme,</hi> Pſalm. 105.14.15. <hi>For the Lord ſhall roare out of Zion, and his voyce out of Ieruſalem,</hi> Amos 1.2. Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not the world wiſe at laſt, when it ſeeth that this is the fountaine of all evills, becauſe it doth entreate ſo contemptuouſly and unworthyly the Church? And the <hi>lightnings</hi> and terrible <hi>thunders,</hi> doe ſignify punishments, and not to be avoided by any meanes, as which doe fall violently upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men from heaven. But to what ende are <hi>voyces</hi> added? Surely voices doe note out often times the craking of thunders, as Exod. 19.16. <hi>And there were voices, and lightnings, and a thicke cloude upon the mount, and the voyce of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet very lowde:</hi> So in chap. 20.18. <hi>And all the people did perceive the voyces and the voice of a trumpet.</hi> But ſeeing in this place there is expreſſe mention of thunders, the voices are referred to ſome other thinge, namely to the ſounde of the trumpet. For he doth allude unto that fearfull ſound of the trumpet in giving of the lawe, wherby the Iſraelites were ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the Tribunall ſeat and iudgement. The ſounde whereof, when it continued and waxed very ſtronge, Moſes ſayd, <hi>I doe feare and quake,</hi> Exod. 19.19. Heb. 12.21. For the expectation of iudgement did more abash and trouble their minde, then the preſent horrour of ſome terrible ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: the feare of which, the minde can ſuſteine in ſome ſorte, unleſſe it be troubled with the conſcience of ſinne: when it shallbe caſt downe with the feeling of this, it quaketh at every shewe of evill, as if torments were prepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red and by and by to be undergone. The voices then here are ſome ſtrange things betokening ſome evill to come, or ſtinges of conſcience, with which the mindes are allwayes tormented, with expectation of ſome more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

This feare shalbe as a torture to the wicked, tearing and vexing with greater torment of minde, then any preſent, though grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous calamity. Such then are the weapons which are layd up in this armo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry: which in deede are drawne out and brought forth in a readines for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of vengeance, even as the uſe either of the whole Church, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity of any of the ſaints privatly doth require. Wherfore there is no cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fe why they should feare the wicked world, for whoſe defenſe ſo grievous punishments are prepared.</p>

                  <hi>¶ And ſeaven lampes of fyre:</hi> After the grace of protection, are declared the giftes of ſanctification: of which the inward are ſignifyed by <hi>the ſeaven burning lampes,</hi> after the account of the ſeaven <hi>ſpirits which are before the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> chap. 1.4. For by the flame of theſe, thoſe lampes doe burne, with that difference onely, wherby the river differreth from the fountayne. The which thinge the lampes doe ſignify, veſſels of a certen and limitted mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whereas the <hi>Spirit</hi> himſelfe is unmeaſurable, and cannot be included in any ſtraight veſſels. For which cauſe he was before moſt free, not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any addition of any meaſurable quantity, where mention was made of him as of the third perſon, of equall glory and maieſty with the Father and the Sonne, chap. 1.4. And theſe lampes are called <hi>the ſeven ſpirits of God,</hi> both becauſe they are gifts that flowe from the Spirit, and alſo there is a moſt ſtraite ioyning togither of the effect with his cauſe. For they be moſt ſweete fruites which the Spirit created in the hearts of the ſaincts, in giving them faith, hope, charity, peace, ioye, praye, and the other things with which the elect are ſanctifyed. They are likened to <hi>lampes of fyre,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of the <hi>lightes</hi> in the Temple, which were to be lighted every day of Aaron and his ſonnes, Exod. 27.20. For the Spirit will have them to be kindled in the hartes of the elect, by the labour of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, through the worde and ſacraments, and not to be expected contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the order delivered to us of himſelfe. There is the number of ſeaven, becauſe of the manifold varietie of giftes, wherewith he adorneth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: as every where that number is uſed to note an infinite number. Laſt of all theſe giftes are compared to fyre (for the lampes are of fyre, &amp; burning before the throne) becauſe they inlighten the minde, &amp; burne up the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the inbread corruption, and kindle a deſyre of all godlines, which Iohn calleth <hi>the Babptiſme of fyre,</hi> Mat. 3.11. And howe great confort ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from thence, that the name of the Spirit himſelfe is attributed to thoſe giftes? <hi>Which are,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſeaven Spirits of God:</hi> From which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full may underſtand, that that force which they feele in their hearts rayſed up of God, is a moſt ſure pledge of God dwelling in them. Such then are
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6819:80"/> the inward giftes, of which the Church shall never be deſtitute: but ſome congregation of the Godly shalbe remayning alwayes, in which thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lampes shall burne.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>There was alſo before the Throne a Sea of glaſſe:</hi> The firſt outward gift which ſerveth for thoſe inward, as the inſtrumentall cauſe, <hi>is the Sea of glaſſe:</hi> which ſeemeth to be ſome very great veſſell and huge lake after the likenes once <hi>of the Sea in the Temple,</hi> of which 1 King. 7 23. <hi>Likewiſe he made a molten Sea.</hi> This <hi>Sea</hi> is to be underſtood of ſuch a veſſell. For howe can that which is before the Throne compaſſed with a company of Elders ſtanding rounde aboute, be ſpred abroad on every ſide like the ſea properly ſo called? The circuite in deede of the <hi>Elders</hi> may extende ſo farre as the compaſſe of the earth, yet it behoveth us to remember that the thinge was shewed to Iohn in a type, that wee should not thinke of any ſuch unmeaſurable ſpace. Both the name and the largeneſſe of the veſſell doe shewe the fulnes of all giftes, which the Church doth drawe from Chriſt unto her ſalvation, <hi>who received the Spirit without meaſure, and from whoſe infinite riches it is beſtowed upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us,</hi> Iohn chap. firſt, ver 16. For to what ende otherwiſe was there ſo bigge a veſſell, at which <hi>Aaron and his ſonnes ſhould waſh their handes and their feete?</hi> For cleanſing whereof, ſome ſmall pitcher or cruſe would had ſufficed? And in deede this Sea sheweth very fitly a certen reſemblance of the whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship, which is to be performed to God. The doctrine often time is compared unto waters: <hi>Hoe,</hi> ſaith Iſaiah, <hi>whoſoever thirſteth, come yee to thoſe waters:</hi> For the carrying away of which, he commendeth no other buckets to be brought, then the <hi>eares: Jnclyne your eare,</hi> ſaith he, chap. 55.1.3. From whence the Miniſters are called <hi>waterers,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6, Baptiſme alſo is ſignifyed by the <hi>Sea,</hi> through which the <hi>Fathers paſſed, and were all baptiſed unto Moſes, in the cloude, and in the Sea,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.1.2. Furthermore the water noteth the ſpirituall drinke of the holy Supper: <hi>And all,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>dranke the ſame ſpirituall drinke,</hi> ver. 4. By the ſame alſo <hi>prayers</hi> are ſignify<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>the Iſraelites being gathered togither to Mizpa drew water and powred it out before the Lord,</hi> to wit, rivers of teares, with earneſt repentance wrunge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, 1 Sam. chap. 7. ver. 5. And noe leſſe is it a ſigne of <hi>thankeſgiving,</hi> as in the Revelation, <hi>they that got the victory over the Beaſt, ſtood at the glaſſy Sea, having the Harpes of God, wherewith they ſunge his prayſes,</hi> chap. 15.2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>this Sea</hi> sheweth by right the whole worship: which in reſpect of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pes is like a <hi>Sea of oyle,</hi> wherewith their heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly fyre is nourrished co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of one this <hi>Sea</hi> is, wee muſt ſee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Epithets; the firſt of which, he ſayth that to be <hi>glaſſy.</hi> How is this? Is it in reſpect of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? There is a glaſſy colour &amp; agreable to the <hi>Sea:</hi> Wherupon <hi>Virgille</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:6819:80"/> the <hi>Fairies,</hi> attributeth the ſame to the <hi>Godeſſes of the Sea: The Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes did ſpinne the fleeces of woll of Miletus, dyed with a deepe colour of glaſſe,</hi> Geor. 4, And againe a little after, —<hi>and all in their glaſſy ſeates, were aſtoniſhed:</hi> glaſſy not in reſpect of the matter, but of the colour &amp; clearnes. So Ovid. <hi>There is a cleare river more bright then glaſſe, a ſacred fountaine,</hi> Epiſt. Sapph. But glaſſy in this place is even, as of glaſſe, shewing rather a shining matter that one may ſee through, then a colour without matter: wherto ſerveth the other Epithet, <hi>like unto Chryſtall.</hi> Glaſſy, to wit for a difference from the legall Sea. Which being made of braſſe, a thick &amp; darke matter, could not be ſeen through of any ſight, 1 King. 7, 23. The face of God did shine upon his, but under thoſe rites &amp; ceremonyes ſomewhat darkly: which thing alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> declared, <hi>putting a vayle over his face, that the children of Jſraell ſhould not looke into the ende of that which was to be aboliſhed,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.13. But contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>all wee beholde with uncovered face, the glory of the Lord as in a glaſſe,</hi> In the ſame place ver. 18. Therefore their Sea is of Braſſe, and ours of Glaſſe, and great is the dignity of the Chriſtian Church, in compariſon of that under the Lawe, conſidering that our worship doth shew us the moſt pleaſant fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of God, as it were through a moſt cleare glaſſe, <hi>how amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> cryed the Pſalmiſt in that darknes, Pſal. 80.1. But how admirable ought the moſt ſweete countenance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be unto us, whom wee with <hi>Peter and thoſe two diſciples, doe ſee ſhyning as the Sunne, &amp; his garments made white as the light,</hi> Mat. 17.1.2. O wee bleſſed men, if wee could have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes our eyes fixed on this glaſſe. There is a certen incomprehenſible ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſty of God to be ſeen in that very creature, but this knowledge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the reprobate, there is noe where any meanes to enioy a ſaving ſight, unleſſe by this glaſſy Sea; God hath replenished it with moſt pure waters, both of knowing and worshipping him truly: of both which he hath layed up ſuch aboundant plenty in this ſea, that there is no neede to fetch any thing from any other ditches.</p>
               <p>And this ought to be the ſcope of all worship, that it may shewe us GODS face: By howe much the more eyther the doctrine or the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes doe hurt or ſtop up our eyes in this matter, by ſo much the more doe both of them ſwerve from the right.</p>
               <p>The other Epithete is <hi>Like unto Chryſtall:</hi> What neede is there of this ſeconde? In deede that he may teach, that that Glaſſe is not onely bright, but even alſo moſt purely bright, which noe other mixed colour doth in noe ſorte darken. For <hi>Chryſtall</hi> is, as it were, voyde and free of any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, approaching the neereſt to the purity of the ayre, which the eyes doe pearſe through almoſt as eaſily.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:6819:81"/>
               <p>Therefore noe humane deviſe and invention is powred into this Sea; but it is pure from all filth added to it, and alſo perfite and abſolute without any thing detracted from it. As it is taught in Deut, 4.2. Such is the worship of the Saints in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom God the Father beholding his elect faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, findeth noe thing in them coloured, nothing maymed and imperfect, nothing filthy and defiled. All worship ought to levell hereto, and be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after this patterne. Others doe interprete theſe things otherwiſe: ſome doe referre this <hi>Sea</hi> to the iudgements of God; but enough was fore shewed touching them, in the thunders and lightnings, Others thinke that it ſignifyeth <hi>a multitude of men living on the earth.</hi> But if this multitude be holy, it was noted before <hi>in the foure and twenty Elders.</hi> But if it be wicked what doth it before the throne? or howe may the <hi>purity of Chryſtall</hi> agree unto it? There is noe need that I should confute other mens interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in many wordes. The very order of the thinges doth shewe eaſily, what cometh nigheſt to the trueth, This onely I will ſay, which is common to this whole booke, in every allegoricall interpretation, before all thinges the purpoſe of the allegory it ſelfe is to be regarded, without which every interpretation shalbe doubtfull and uncerten, and of noe weight: but if wee shall knowe that well, and shall adde to it prudently the other circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances, wee may drawe noe leſſe conſtant ſenſe from an allegory, then fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other playne place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And in the middeſt of the throne, and which compaſſed the throne foure Beaſts:</hi> The ſecond outward gift are <hi>Beaſts:</hi> whoſe qualityes come firſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which reſpect the preparation to their office, if in a fewe wordes wee shall firſt ſee of what ſortes the beaſts are. Which is heard to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the iudgement of the Interpreters, they are in ſo manyfold differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, wee will propounde in a word, as wee have begun and intended, that which ſeemeth to be moſt neerly ioyned with the trueth. They are ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and Miniſters of God, all whoſe labour is beſtowed in preaching the word and in looking to the other things which belonge to the Eccleſiaſticall po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licy. For firſt, it is manifeſt that they are <hi>men:</hi> for ſo they ſing together with the Elders, <hi>thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood,</hi> chap. 5.9. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing there is two ſortes of <hi>Redeemed:</hi> one of the <hi>people,</hi> another of the <hi>Miniſters:</hi> the very place in which they ſerve, ſheweth that they belonge to this ſecond degree. For they are converſant betweene the hygheſt <hi>Throne</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> ſet rounde aboute. Therefore they approch neerer unto God, and are as his meſſengers betweene both. Hereunto is added, that they are leaders of the publike action, as is manifeſt after at the ninth ver. Laſtly, they are repreſented ſo in winges, eyes, and their whole shape, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:6819:81"/> they may be moſt furnished, to performe this office. Neither are they any of the excellent men of the age paſſed, but <hi>Miniſters</hi> to come, to which ſorte of thinges this whole Prophecy is applyed, as that of the firſt verſe hath taught, <hi>I will ſhewe thee the things that muſt be done hereafter.</hi> They are cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led <hi>Beaſts</hi> becauſe of that lively force of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> wherby they are quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that ſpirituall life, which they effect in others, God working togi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther with them. In which reſpect the like ſervants of God, full of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and moſt nimble to diſpatch all ſortes of buſineſſes committed to them for to doe, are named <hi>Beaſts</hi> in Ezech. chap. 1. But if they be <hi>Miniſters,</hi> how may I count them among the giftes? The faithfull Miniſters are of the chiefe giftes of God as he ſaith of the <hi>Levites; Beholde I have taken your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from among the children of Jſraell: they are given you for a gift, for the Lord to adminiſter the ſervice of the Tabernacle of the congregation,</hi> Numb. 18.16. &amp;c. And Paul, <hi>Let noe man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>reioyce in men, for all things are yours, and Paul, and Apollos, and Cephas,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21. Moſt clearly to the Epheſians, <hi>when he aſcended up on high, he lead captivity captive, and gave giftes unto men, ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> chap. 4.8.11. Theſe thinges being thus eſtablished, let us nowe ſee the propertyes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As touching the place, they are betweene the throne, and which did compaſſe the throne, <hi>both in the middes of the throne, and round about the throne.</hi> Not in the very middes in reſpect of the place, where one ſate like to a <hi>Iaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtone,</hi> ver. 3. nor becauſe they did hold up the throne, as the <hi>Bulles Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons braſen ſea:</hi> under which they were put in that manner, <hi>that their backe partes lay hidden within, their fore partes ſtood out abroade,</hi> 1 King. 7.25. For when the foure Beaſts did fall downe, howe should not the throne fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with them? For it is read after, <hi>that the foure Beaſts did fall downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lambe,</hi> chap. 5.8. But <hi>in the middes,</hi> hath the ſame force, as to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene,</hi> or in ſome parte: as Abraham is called <hi>a Prince of God in the middes of the children of Cheth,</hi> Gen. 23.6. that is among, and ſo every where in other places. Wherfore Theod. Beza hath tranſlated it playnly, <hi>betweene the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and which did compaſſe the throne.</hi> Wherby is ſignifyed, that the <hi>Beaſts</hi> in reſpect of their office doe come nigher to Gods maieſty, then the <hi>Elders,</hi> &amp; in ſome parte to touch that ſeate, which shyneth with Gods glory, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument of the adminiſtration given to them. There is the number of foure according to the ſtate of the Chriſtian miniſtery augmented. For as the Chriſtian congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is twice ſo greate as the Legall: that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting <hi>of foure and twenty Elders,</hi> this of the twelve <hi>Patriarches:</hi> ſo there is a double reſpect of the Miniſters, of foure Beaſts, unto the foure and twenty <hi>Elders,</hi> unto the one onely <hi>tribe of Levi,</hi> in regard of the <hi>twelve Princes</hi> of Iſraell.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:6819:82"/> In reſpect of the <hi>Elders</hi> which ſit round about the hygheſt throne, they are foure beames of the two diameters, dividing themſelves into ſtraight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, by the which the circumference is conioyned every way, and equally with the middes of the throne. So diſpoſed toward all quarters, by the foure chiefe corners, that as the river of Paradiſe divided into foure heades, they might be able moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly to water the whole Church.

Hoſ. 4.6. But the eyes both before and behinde, is a kind of knowledge, wherby they knowe both thinges paſt, and alſo ſee things preſent, and reſting onely upon the divine oracles, doe wiſely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive things before hande. The <hi>Miniſters</hi> being altogither <hi>like unto a houſe-holder, which bringeth out of his treaſure things both newe and olde,</hi> Mat. 13.52. Such kinde of knowledge both the auncient ſcriptures <hi>Moſes, the Pſalmes, the Prophets,</hi> and alſo <hi>the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles,</hi> doe miniſter. Out of theſe fountaynes may aboundantly be drawne, that <hi>the man of God</hi> may be furnished with eyes, both behinde and before. God in Chriſt doe account all eyed Paſtors, who according to the tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t receyved, doe inſtruct faithfully, the people committed unto them, howſoever much humane ignorance be in the beſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>And the firſt Beaſt was like a Lyon:</hi> Such is the common property of all the <hi>Beaſts;</hi> the proper forme of every one is, of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> firſt: the ſecond of a <hi>Calfe:</hi> the third of a <hi>Man;</hi> the fourth of an <hi>Eagle:</hi> Which foure diverſe formes, almoſt all the Interpreters doe refferre to the foure <hi>Evangeliſtes.</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:6819:82"/> And ſo as according to Aretas <hi>the Lyon</hi> is Iohn, <hi>the Eagle</hi> Marke: according to others, <hi>the Eagle</hi> Iohn. Marke <hi>the Leon.</hi> Auguſtine will have the <hi>Lyon</hi> to be Mathewe, Marke <hi>a man:</hi> ſo uncerten are they. But wee may not thinke, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> was ſo ignorant an artificer, that there should be neede of his name to be inſcribed, to whom every picture doth belonge, or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <hi>the Lyon, the Aygle and the man,</hi> could not be diſcerned one from another. That of the firſt verſe doth ende the controverſy about this point. <hi>Which muſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be done hereafter.</hi> Which wordes doe forbidde to looke backe, and to minde that which is paſt, but rather commaundeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome future thinge. They ſeeme therefore to perteine to thoſe giftes, wherewith every one of the faithfull Miniſters are to be adorned in ſome parte; beſides thoſe giftes of knowledge. For the eyes ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all, every one ought to be learned: the other giftes may be diverſe, as God hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to every one privatly for the uſe &amp; neceſsity of the Church. Although noe man can be voide altogither of the other vertues, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede partaker of one. From whence <hi>Ezechiell</hi> attributeth theſe foure faces to every one of the Beaſts, chap. 1.6. And in deede there ought to beare ſway in each one, <hi>the courage of the Lyon, the patience of Oxen, the prudence of men, laſt of all the contempt of earthly things of the Eagles.</hi> Yet not without cauſe ſome proper thing here is applyed to every one ſeverally. Peradventure that therby the Spirit may shewe in what principall vertues the <hi>Paſtors</hi> should excell others according to the foure diverſe ſeaſons. The firſt age after Iohn gave famous men in all thoſe vertues, chap. 6.1.3.5.7. Whoſe fortitude yet moſt of all appeared, wherby they did both ſuffer and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt fierce cruelty of the tyrants. The age following after <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> miniſtred <hi>Oxen,</hi> when liberty was taken from the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> &amp; every excellent man was oppreſſed under the yoke of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of humane ceremonies. The Ghoſpell recovering life againe by <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe</hi> &amp; <hi>Luther,</hi> affoarded <hi>men,</hi> who being weary of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> bondage, both deſyred earneſtly and at length obtayned the Chriſtian freedome. Wee doe expect yet Eagles, which the calling of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> will give at length, when the Ghoſpell shalbe reſtored fully, and brought to his perfit glory, which this Prophecy will shewe shall come shortly. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bishops shall beholde the Sunne with ſteddy ſight, and shall ſearch out with mervaylous quicknes of underſtanding, whatſoever yet lyeth hydde in the trueth of God: neither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our times &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, shall they baſely creepe on the earth minding earthly things, but shall fly upon high, having all their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>And every of the Beaſts, &amp;c.</hi> Hitherto of the form of their body: the form of their winges is deſcribed by a triple property, <hi>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; eyes.</hi> Every
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:6819:83"/> Every one hath ſix winges, ſo many as had alſo <hi>the Angels</hi> in Iſaiah, 6.2. but not of like uſe, as it ſeemeth. For the <hi>Angels</hi> with two did cover their face, with two their feete, with two they did fly. But the placing of them of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> is ſuch, as it is not fit for this thing. For they are rounde about them, behind, on their ſides, before them, that they cannot ſerve fitly to cover either the face or feete. Neither in deede are they given them for flight. For what neede have they to fly, who have the place of their abode betweene the throne and the circuite of the Elders? Therefore they belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to ayde &amp; ſuccour, by which they fly moſt readily into every parte to helpe others. Such an office is twofold in the Church, one of <hi>Helpers,</hi> an other of <hi>Governours,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.28. That belongeth to the <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Widowes:</hi> whom once the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> appointed to looke to the poore, and thoſe that had any infirmity of body, by a divine ordinance, <hi>leaſt that they attending to ſuch buſineſſe, ſhould become leſſe carefull about prayers and the adminiſtration of the word,</hi> Act. 6.2. &amp;c. 1 Tim. 5.9. <hi>This office belongeth to the Elders,</hi> who are appointed to governe onely mens manners, and are moderators of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline. Teir office is shewed by the eyes, of which the winges are full wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin. For to what ende els should there be newe eyes in the winges, when before the whole body was beſet with eyes? In deede thoſe eyes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are of knowledge and ſcience, and therfore doe ſticke neerer, being in the body it ſelfe, which the <hi>Miniſters</hi> may as well want as their owne eyes, wich are ioyned to their body with ſo neere a coniunction: but theſe eyes of the <hi>winges,</hi> being removed a little farther of, are placed as it were in a watch tower to ſearch out every ons manners, executing the Office of watches and wardes, as the Apoſtle sheweth, ſaying, <hi>Obey your Teachers, &amp; ſubmitte your ſelves to them, for they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> Heb. 13.17. And how fitly is it that this kind of eyes is within and under the winges? For they muſt looke onely to the flocke, <hi>which dependeth upon them,</hi> as Peter warneth 1 Epiſt. 5.2. They ought not to care for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers flocke; or at leaſt they muſt watch over the Chriſtian people, <hi>For what have wee to doe to iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are without: wee muſt iudge them that are within: God iudged them that are without,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.12.13. Such a Tabernacle was ſeene in the mount, as touching his miniſters; according to which patterne the Chriſtian Church was framed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whoſe beſides the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> ordained alſo theſe <hi>Helpers</hi> in every congregation, which should go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the reformation of manners togither with the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> whom Paul mentioneth, commaunding <hi>that the Elders which rule well ſhould be had in dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble honou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>: ſpecially they that labour in the word &amp; doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. For ſuch are blinde, and which in underſtanding doe not underſtand, who avouch
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:6819:83"/> that this two kinde of <hi>Elders</hi> can not be proved from this place. Further, what elſe shall wee underſtand to be thoſe <hi>Governements</hi> in the 1 Cor. 12.28. then the office of them, who are appointed to this charge? In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the verſe Paul reckened up, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, and Teachers,</hi> upon whom lyeth the adminiſtration of the word: unto which, after ſome other things interpoſed, namely, namely <hi>Powers, Gifts of healings, and Helpes,</hi> at length he adioyneth <hi>Governements,</hi> that by this order interrupted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued by ſo great a ſpace, wee might knowe that theſe <hi>Governements,</hi> is a certen diſtinct thing from the charge of teaching. Furthermore, of what ſorte were thoſe <hi>Elders,</hi> which were converſant togither with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the <hi>Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> Act. 15.4.6? Were they ſuch as beſtowed all their labour in teaching the people in the publike aſſemblyes? It is likely that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> abiding there, layed aſyde this care of teaching, and gave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to execute a certen Lordshippe. A few yeeres before, they ſuffered not them ſelves to be pulled from prayers and teaching, Act. 6.4. but at length peradventure this exceeding love was abated; they followed their eaſe, and gave over the duty and charge gladly to the <hi>Elders.</hi> Away with this folly: the holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not ſleepy with ſlouthfulnes, neither did they affect ambitious dominion over others, which they forbad others by their example, 1 Pet. 5.7. But to their power labouring in that which was the principall, they uſed thoſe <hi>Elders</hi> as the eyes of the winges to take good heede to the holines of their flocke. It is alſo evident from the uſe of the primitive <hi>Church,</hi> as was ſayd before in chap, 2.2. But firſt of all <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is a ſubſtantiall witneſſe in this matter, upon the 1 to Tim. chap. 2.4. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo the Synagogue, and afterward the Church had Elders, without whoſe counſell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done in the Church, which by what negligence it is growne out of uſe, J know not, unleſſe by the ſlouthfulnes or rather pride of the Teachers, while they alone wilbe thought ſome what:</hi> Such are his wordes: from which it doth moſt clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peare, what ſorte of Elders the Primitive Church had; ſuch in deede, who with ioint ſtudyes and counſels regarded the dignity of every one togither with the Paſtors. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> complayneth that theſe were worne away (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe other preaching Elders fayled not in his time, neyther could fayle) and that by the negligence or pryde of the Teachers. And it is manifeſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Hierome,</hi> that an other kinde of governing was by and by growne in uſe in ſtead of thoſe Elders. For he mentioneth to <hi>Ruſticus, of the Eccleſiaſticalll Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat: The Church,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath a Senat, a company of Elders, without whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, the Monkes may doe nothing:</hi> And againe: <hi>And wee have our Senate of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> Gratian. C. 16. q. 1. The Church. But the Senate was become much unlike to the integrity and inſtitution of the firſt time, as wee learned even
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:6819:84"/> nowe from <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> after whoſe time &amp; age men labour in vaine to finde out this kinde of <hi>Elders,</hi> which he complayneth to have perished and come to nothing before his times. Thoſe winges therfore togither with the eyes are thoſe <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Elders:</hi> Of which what picture more fitte could have ben given? In them is required <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> in theſe, <hi>diligence;</hi> Rom. 12.8. That firſt is ſignifyed by the <hi>eyes in the wings:</hi> this ſecond by <hi>the wings with eyes.</hi> From which firſt is perceyved howe neceſſary theſe Offices are in the Church. For they are the <hi>winges of the Miniſters.</hi> What is a bird without winges? Yet this lacke is more dammageable, becauſe a bird being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of winges, perisheth her ſelfe alone: the Paſtours being voide of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the whole flockes are ſet in daunger of deſtruction. For they are winges of helping, as wee have ſaid, wherby aide is miniſtred not ſo much to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters themſelves, as to the people. And ſeeing the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had need of <hi>Deacons,</hi> that a more neceſſary worke might not be left of them: could they by themſelves obſerve every ons life, without the hinderance of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the word? Therefore they tooke to themſelves the winges full of eyes, which the <hi>Beaſtes</hi> have before the Throne, and have taught by their owne example, howe maimed and lame the <hi>Paſtors</hi> are, to whom theſe winges are wanting.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee learne, that theſe Offices are advantages, and additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as parts hanging to the Paſtours, ioyned to them as neceſſarily, as winges to the body, from whence they drawe life, and by whoſe benefit they are moved and upholden. And that therefore a divorſe is not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made betweene them, as in the common wealth of the <hi>Scaphuſians,</hi> where none of the MINISTERS are preſent in the Conſiſtory, but lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned men out of the Senate, and for the moſt part ſome DOCTOR of the Lawes is choſen amonge the Iudges of the Conſiſtory: See for this, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias Simlerus in his treatiſe of the Common Wealth of the Helvetians.</p>
               <p>Neyther are thoſe excuſes of any moment, wherby it is pretended, that another manner of governing not leſſe profitable is uſed in ſtead of <hi>ELDERS</hi> and <hi>DEACONS,</hi> as it is done in Englande. Is it not, ſay they provided in a ſpeciall manner, for the poore, by the ſtatutes of this Kingdome? And doe not the Church-Wardens preſent wicked men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Commiſſaryes? What neede is there of other <hi>Elders and Deacons,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially indeede, ſeeing all that way is wholy ſevered from all overſeeing of the Paſtors, to whome alone theſe winges ought to be faſtened, and not to any other body of Commiſſaries? God give therefore <hi>Winges to the Beaſts,</hi> that his people may be holpen, all whoſe holines almoſt is loſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Paſtors being deſtitute of their winges full of eyes, there is none
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6819:84"/> that with an earneſt and true affection of minde, will looke into the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſikeneſſes, and fly ſpeedily for to heale them. Laſtly our brethren are to be intreated, that they will ſpeake more modeſtly of the ordinance of God, leaſt giving themſelves to reproaches and raylings, they be found to open their mouth againſt heaven it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Day and night without ceaſing, ſaying:</hi> Hitherto hath ben the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto their Office, nowe it followeth, of what ſorte their Office it ſelfe is, which is ſhewed by their unweariſome diligence in prayſing the Lord. Which one thing in deede sheweth ſufficiently that theſe Beaſts, by their charge and Office are ſtewards of the Myſteries of God, to wit, <hi>Paſtours, in whom he hath put the word of recenciliation, and whom he hath made his Ambaſſadours, who ſhould intreate and pray the people in CHRIST ſteade, that they would be reconciled unto God.</hi> It is in deede the duty of every one to prayſe God without ceaſing: Such diligence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> requireth in all Chriſtians, ſaying, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle of the Theſſalonians chapter five, ver. 16. But eſpecially it belongeth to them, who ought to give themſelves to this ſtudy with their whole mindes and thoughts. For as <hi>Paul</hi> councelleth Virgins, <hi>that they might cleave faſt to the Lord without any diſtraction,</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthes, chapter ſeaven, ver. 35. That should be the onely care of them, that bende themſelves with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence unto holy things, all whoſe buſineſſe both in the day time and in the night is beſtowed in meditating on the things of the Lord: <hi>You,</hi> ſayth the Pſalmiſt, <hi>which ſtand in the houſe of God every night,</hi> Pſalme 134. ver. 1. Were there any prayers before day breake, or in the night time, as in the Monaſteryes of the ſuperſtitious Monkes? Not at all: But this kinde of ſpeaking sheweth that their whole labour was ſpente in worshipping the Lord: Such as then was the ſtudy of the Levites, and of them eſpecially, who departed not from the Temple neither day nor night, for the ſpace of the weekes of their courſe, in the ſecond booke of the Kinges 11.5. &amp; in Luke chapter firſt, ver. 23. And ſuch ought to be the care of all, who deale with holy thinges by profeſsion</p>
               <p>They who are deteyned with the affaires of this life, becauſe they have their mindes withdraen from the contemplation of heavenly things, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily may be ſayd to leave ſometime their care of ſerving God, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Miniſters. Seeing then ſo continuall a paynes is required to the Miniſters, may they intermeddle with other Politicall and civill affaires? Shall they whoſe mindes ought never to be vacant from holy meditations, ſo farre intangle themſelves with earthly cares, that they can minde very little divine thinges? Chriſt, who alone was fitte for every adminiſtration,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:6819:85"/> would not be a iudge to divide the inheritance between the diſagreeing brethren: Which office he refuſed, not for any inability to performe it, but onely for our exemple. To whom alſo he hath appointed boundes of our power, leaſt by wandring without our limites, wee should be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable both to our ſelves, and alſo to others. <hi>The Princes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiles beare rule over them, and the Nobles exerciſe power over them, but it ſhall not be ſo amonge you,</hi> Mat. 20.25.26. Of which commandement when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles underſtood this to be the meaning, that they should take upon them nothing that might hinder never ſo little their holy function, they would not ſuffer ſo much as that the care of the poore should be layd upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, though moſt neerly ioyned with godlines, that they might not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any whit from their duty. Therefore the Romish Antichriſt, with his Prelates, hath ceaſed long agoe in many ages paſt, to be in the number of theſe <hi>Beaſts.</hi> Howe farre alſo are our Bishops from them, who have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prayers &amp; the adminiſtration of the word, not that they may looke to the poore, but that they may handle civill affayres and enioy the honours of this world? Whom thou mayeſt ſee oftener in the iudgement ſeat, then in the Pulpite, and to differre nothing from the Politike Magiſtrates, but onely in name and apparrell. Doe they day and night extolle our God with meet prayſes of his holines? God open their eyes, that they may ſee howe excellent things they leave, for thing of no value, that at length ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their errour they may returne to better things, al trifling lets being caſt away. The Pſalmiſt telleth openly, that <hi>they are bleſſed, which dwell in the houſe of the Lord, and that in this reſpect, becauſe they prayſe God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi> Pſal. 84.5. What then shall wee chaunge with this office, which ſo great King being deſtitute of, envied, that I may ſo ſay, to others, through a godly zeale? But too much it may be, is already ſpoken of this matter: too much in deede to him that ſpeaketh the trueth, but to all that love their errours, I doe feare that they will not be enough. The office of theſe <hi>Beaſts</hi> is declared, not onely by this care, but alſo by the forme it ſelfe of the thankeſgiving, for they cry, <hi>Holy, Holy. Holy:</hi> by which thriſe repeated crying togither, they prayſe the one onely <hi>Iehovah,</hi> ſeeing in repeating they ſay one certen thinge: which one alſo they acknowledge to be three, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating thriſe, that which they gave to one: wherby likewiſe they eſteeme every each one perſon of equall honour, commending each with equall prayſe. For holines containeth within it all prayſe, which ſignifyeth ſuch a purity, which is ſprinkled and mixed with noe ſpotte or blemish. And this the Beaſts doe give to God, not onely ſetting forth the ſame ſoe in words, but alſo in making the people holy, or at leaſt in uſing that labour wherby
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6819:85"/> to their utmoſt power they may make them. From whence of all the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monialls of Gods prayſe, this chiefly doth ſounde and ringe againe in the lyppes of them that ſerve God. Some bookes doe repeate theſe wordes ſix times: but <hi>Aretas</hi> agreeth with our copyes, and theſe wordes are in other places of Scripture, Iſay 6.3. So is the title of holines: this the <hi>Beaſts</hi> doe ſet forth by a double kinde of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Trueth,</hi> wherunto perteineth that diſtributive nowne, <hi>which is,</hi> and <hi>which was,</hi> and <hi>which is to come,</hi> as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, chap. 1.4.7. And they mention firſt of all the <hi>Power,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible glory of <hi>holines,</hi> which is moſt hard where one hath liberty to doe what he will. He that can doe all thinges, and yet in the leaſt thinge abuſeth not his power and authority, it muſt needes be that his glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry exceedeth the comprehending of every minde. Againe, howe hard is it to keepe the promiſe which thou haſt made, when they to whom thou haſt promiſed doe breake their promiſe almoſt every moment? O therfore the unmeaſurable holineſſe of our God, whoſe truth mens infidelity doth not hinder.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>And when thoſe Beaſts ſhall give:</hi> Hitherto the giftes, with which God doth notably adorne his Church, nowe the <hi>worſhip</hi> is deſcribed, to which the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> togither doe earneſtly bende themſelves. The ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner whereof is ſuch that the <hi>Beaſts</hi> have the chiefe doing in the action, and goe before the <hi>Elders</hi> with their voice, as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> are wonte in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly of the people. For theſe thinges are ſpoken according to that order, which God hath appointed in his <hi>Church,</hi> wherby all the people doe give worship to God, the <hi>Miniſter</hi> being the leader. But it is to be obſerved, that this action of <hi>giving glory</hi> doth differ in a reſpect from that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe. For that perteined to private care, which is continuall, their whole office tending to this onely ende: this is proper to their publike function, and at certen time, as is manifeſt from thoſe thinges which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in the next verſe. As touching the wordes, Theod. Beza tranſlateth, <hi>when they did give,</hi> and ſo the other wordes <hi>they did fall downe, they did caſt of,</hi> by the imperfect tence: but the property of the time is to be kept, ſeeing a future thinge is here foreshewed, and not a thing paſt reported.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>The foure and twenty Elders ſhall fall downe:</hi> The action of the people go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verned by the conduct of the <hi>Miniſters.</hi> And it conſiſteth in two thinges, in geſture in this verſe, and in words in the following. The geſture is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, of <hi>caſting downe</hi> themſelves before him that ſitteth on the throne, of <hi>worſhipping,</hi> and <hi>caſting of their crownes.</hi> The firſt ſignifyeth their cheerfull haſt, that at the voyce of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> they fall downe by and by. The ſecond, the iuſt worshippe given to him, to whome alone it is due. The third, the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6819:86"/> ſincere trueth of their minde, in performing this adoration, in that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their owne dignity, they acknowledge themſelves his ſervaunts, before whoſe throne they caſt their crownes. But how, wilt thou ſay, doe the Elders fall downe, when the <hi>Beaſts</hi> doe give glory, ſeeing the <hi>Beaſts</hi> are employed in this labour day and night without ceaſing? Doe the Elders never ſit in their thrones, but fall downe alwayes proſtrate on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de? Wee muſt remember that which I ſaid even nowe, that the private care of the <hi>Beaſts</hi> is one thing, their <hi>publike action</hi> an other. That hath noe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, this is performed with certen reſpites: to this alone this throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of themſelves perteineth. From whence there is a double argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment, that all theſe thinges belong typically to the Chriſtian aſſemblyes on earth. There are noe ſet times of worship in the heavens, but all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity is beſtowed about this thing. Secondly, neither shall there be any neede of leaders and rulers to performe the worshippe. <hi>For Prophecy ſhall then ceaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. much more the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Policy,</hi> which is orday<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in reſpect of this: but every one being a Prieſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onely by right, but alſo in practize shall prayſe <hi>God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt,</hi> without the mediation and helpe of any other then himſelfe. Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this type is proper to the Church on earth, let every one conſider with himſelfe earneſtly, howe greatly it belongeth to them, to frequent the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike aſſemblyes with all diligence, that as often as the <hi>Beaſts</hi> give glory to him that ſitteth on the throne, he may fall downe before the throne, and worshippe him that liveth for ever. Certenly they that contemptuouſly ſit at home, and neglect the congregations of the faints, or in the meane time make iourneyes and withdrawe themſelves in any other unneceſſary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, shewe openly tha they belonge not at all to that moſt honorable com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Elders.</hi> And let not any deceave himſelfe, by his honours, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnityes and excellency, as though the publike aſſemblyes, were either of the unskilfull multitude, or of the baſe people, and that he might either be preſent or abſent at his pleaſure: but let him beholde here Kinges atten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to the voice of the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> nor that once or twice, and at certen tymes, but <hi>whenſoever the Beaſts give glory:</hi> that is, as often as they doe execute their publike office. The prayſing of God of theſe, and their adoration of God are ioyned allwayes togither: ſo that neither may any thinke that he is free and diſcharged from his duty, neither to have performed it enough at ſome fewe times.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Thou art worthy o Lord:</hi> The prayſing which the Elders uſe in wordes is noe other thing then a ſubſcribing to the crying out and shouting of the <hi>Beaſts:</hi> theſe celebrate the <hi>holines, Dominion, omnipotency and trueth</hi> of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6819:86"/> God. The <hi>Elders</hi> nowe doe ſinge togither, <hi>thou art worthy indeede o Lord, to receave glory and honour,</hi> which wee and all thy creatures worthily doe give to thee: as though unto the ſung of prayſes of the Miniſters, the people should give their conſent, ſaying <hi>Amen.</hi> But howe may God receive <hi>power?</hi> They meane the prayſe of all vertue and power. Power can not be given to God otherwiſe, but onely by acknowledging and prayſing. Which then shineth forth moſt cleerly, when he sheweth his ſtrength extraordinarily, both in delivering his owne and alſo in deſtroying his enemyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For thou haſt created all things:</hi> The people ought not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the thankes given by the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in the meane time themſelves being voyde of all knowledge of their owne, as it commeth to paſſe in the Papacy, where after the prayers not underſtood is ſung <hi>Amen,</hi> by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull common people, or ſome as they will, ſupplying their place: but their conſent ought to come from a true faith, and that not confuſed and implicite, but of which a true ſenſe and feeling is ſetled in every ons harte peculiarly. For the God of reaſon, requireth a reaſonable worshippe, not unknowne, rash and voyd of counſell. Whereupon not without cauſe is added from what fountayne the declaration of the conſent of the <hi>Elders,</hi> to wit, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne acknowledging of the exceeding power of God both in creating all thinges, and alſo in preſerving the ſame: and noe leſſe from the ſenſe of his moſt free good will, by which alone being moved, he made all thinges in the beginning, and governeth and preſerveth the ſame at this day, according to that ſaying, <hi>Who worketh all thinges, after the counſell of his will,</hi> Ephe. chap. 1. ver. 11. For which cauſe, there is repeated in the ende of the verſe, <hi>they have ben created,</hi> that wee may underſtande that the will of God not onely hath rule in governing things at this time, but alſo that it gave the firſt originall to the ſame. And ſo is the patterne of the Chriſtian Church, ſo much the more famous then that of the Lawe, by how much heaven in which Iohn ſawe this figure, is more excellent then the Mountaine where Moſes ſawe the Tabernacle. There is the ſame ende and purpoſe of both: of this that it might be a patterne of the worshippe to the Legall people, which should holde even to the time of reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of that, that it might be a type unto Chriſtians, according to what ſquare, they should frame all their aſſemblyes, both generally and ſpecially. Graunt O moſt high God that wee may be founde as faithfull in bringing backe all thinges unto the Heavenly patterne, as Moſes was unto that earthly.</p>

                  <hi>Afterward I ſaw at the right hand:</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tranſlation hath <hi>In the right hande,</hi> as alſo the Interpreter of Aretas; but all the Greeke copies with one conſent have <hi>at the right hande.</hi> They peradventure have put it in the abla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive caſe, becauſe it followeth after in the ſeave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th verſe, <hi>that the Lambe tooke the booke from the right hand.</hi> But this is noe ſufficient cauſe to departe from the naturall property of the wordes, when it may be that the weaknes of the creatures might be made to appeare the more, the booke at the firſt was not in the right hande, but at the right hande: from whence if there were noe power to open it being offered and layd before without asking, much leſſe would there have ben any if he had held it in his handes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when the debility of the Creatures was found out, the booke was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into his handes, that the dignity of the Lambe might be the better knowne, not taking it up haſtily lying at his ſide, but receaving it from hande to hande. As touching the intent of this viſion, it ſeemeth good to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> after the lively repreſentation of the true Church in the former chapter, (which was to be layd as the fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all the building follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6819:88"/> before that he should come to the particular Propheſyes) to put men in minde of the incomprehenſible excellency of this Prophecy, For wee are wont, ſuch is our ſlouthfulnes, to paſſe by very greate and excellent thinges careleſly and ſleepingly, unleſſe peradventure ſome body pull us by the eare, and require inſtantly diligence, mentioning the greatnes of the thing. Leaſt perchance the ſame thing should fall out in this place, he ſetteth before our eyes, that this is a Prophecy of that kinde, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth in it all the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers that at to be undergone of the Church through her whole race on earth, yet wrapped in ſo great obſcurity, that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minde can beholde it a farre off, much leſſe unfolde the ſame to others. An argument in deede moſt worthy to be knowen, and farre moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of all thinges, opening to us the hidden Myſteries, with exceeding great deſyre whereof men are inflamed: or otherwiſe in ſearching out of them, they torment themſelves rashly and in vayne. And yet nevertheleſſe it is not to be deſyred onely for this cauſe to knowe it, but becauſe alſo it conteyneth events of that moment, that it would be very hurtfull and for rowfull to the Church, if they should wholy be concealed. Therefore Iohn wept, being privy to the dangers, and togither therewith alſo min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the lacke of a guide.</p>
               <p>And in deede the Church hardly holdeth on her courſe, though this lampe be given her: Howe miſerable had shee ben, left utterly in darknes, and not perceiving ſufficiently eyther which waye shee should goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or where to ſet her foote ſafely? Iohn therefore had had iuſt cauſe to weepe, if there had ben hope noe where of opening the ſealed booke. But the ſudden aſſault of griefe, bereft the holy man of underſtanding, and ſuffered him not to thinke in whom there was ability, while at length he knewe by the putting in minde of an other. Therefore this Prophecy is famous for the worthynes of the argument, excellency of the Myſtery, ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fruict, but farre way moſt excellent, becauſe he alone was founde worthy to open the ſame, who by his death founde out a redemption for the elect.</p>
               <p>This is that thing for which the Church on earth, the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, laſtly the univerſall Creature reioyceth greatly, and that not for a glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious shewe without the trueth of the thinge, as the manner is in humane writinges, in which the thinges are amplifyed for to adorne and ſet them forth, but from a true feeling and iuſt cauſe of reioycing, as hereafter wee ſhall ſee through Gods his helpe. In the meane time shall not this excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ioye of Heaven and Earth kindle in men a diligence to reade, a deſyre to underſtand, and an endevoure to obſerve? It is in deede a thing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:6819:88"/> worthy of our ſerious meditation, into which I have digreſſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in many wordes, becauſe I ſee that the Interpreters, eyther not to have marked the intendement of this chapter, or at the leaſt, otherwiſe then was meete, to have ſpoken nothing at all, of a matter very needfull and neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ A Booke written within and on the backeſide:</hi> The firſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophecy is from a <hi>Booke, a copious writting,</hi> and <hi>Seaven Seales</hi> in this verſe. That which is recorded in a Booke, muſt without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy be certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being a faithfull helper of the memory: whereas that which is noe otherwiſe grounded then onely upon the memory, may eaſily in continuance of time, eyther be utterly extinguiſhed, or at the leaſt wiſe cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupted. Whereupon GOD biddeth Ieremy, for the greater credit of that Prophecy, <hi>to write all the wordes that he ſpake unto him in a Booke,</hi> in the thirty chapter of Ieremy and in the 2. verſe. So carefull is he to provide againſt our doubting, that wee should not thinke otherwiſe of the things, then of ſuch as are written in publike bookes, &amp; graven as it were in braſſe, ſo as they can neyther be altered nor forgotten. The plenteous writing is shewed, in that <hi>the booke was written within and on the backe ſide, on both ſides of the leafe.</hi> And he ſpeaketh after the olde ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of writing in ſomewhat lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge parchments, which afterward were wounde about ſome rounde ſmooth peece of wood, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they were called volumes, &amp; <hi>Chriſt is ſayd to have unrolled the booke, and rolled it up againe,</hi> as in Luke chapter 4 verſe 17. And the outſide (that I may uſe the wordes of the moſt learned Theod. Beza) alway remayned cleane, unleſſe the inſide was not able to containe the whole writing, for then they wrote on the outward part; which ſorte of writinges were called <hi>exteriour writings,</hi> as being written on the backe ſide. This ſo great prolixitie therefore, did containe not onely the chiefe points which peradventure might be included in ſome narrow place, but alſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moſt ſmall thinges: ſo that neither is there any neede to ſeeke and fetch ought from any other place, which perteineth to the knowledge of future thinges: and that wee knowe alſo that nothing can be done without the will of God. The Complutent edition and ſome others read <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>on the backe ſide,</hi> is more often uſed: from whence is <hi>written on the backe ſide,</hi> as wee have shewed a little before. Finally, howe pretious are theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryes, which God hath with himſelfe, ſealed up with ſo many ſeales?. The creatures could not ſo much as to <hi>looke</hi> on the <hi>BOOKE,</hi> as is in the fourth verſe, much leſſe was there neede of ſeales for to hidde from them. But by theſe meanes he will declare and manifeſt, howe greatly wee ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence his ſecrets.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:6819:89"/>2 <hi>And J ſaw a ſtrong Angell publiſhing;</hi> There is a great dignity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, from <hi>the certenty, largenes,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſcaling up;</hi> but nowe a greater appeareth, ſeeing the highnes thereof ſurmounteth every created Spirit. For it is not of that kinde, which the more prudent ſorte of men can comprehende by any skilfull foreknowledg, but wherein all muſt needes confeſſe their igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance. The which for to shewe, he alludeth to the manner of <hi>Princes,</hi> who in difficult thinges are wont by great rewards to provoke their ſubiects by the voyce of a Cryer to try their ſtrength, and there is almoſt none, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch buſineſſe, ſome ſmall hope will not thruſt forward to make tryall. If ſo be that noe man cometh forth, what is this elſe, than an open confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their imbecillity. So the Angell is ſent to enquire, <hi>who is worthy to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the booke?</hi> If noe man offereth himſelfe, let us acknowledge our owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, and the power of our Mediatour: and togither alſo let us honour with due reverence theſe holy myſteryes: for which cauſe God cauſeth in us this feeling of our owne want of power, as of old in Adam, before who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ere he gave him a wife, he ſet all creatures, that noe fit helper being found, he might make the more accounte of the wife given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Who is worthy:</hi> He maketh not inquiry of the power and ſtrength, but of the deſerte and worthynes. For even all the creatures if they should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire togither, are able to doe nothing, to wringe out perforce the things from God. Whatſoever wee obtayne, wee enioye it at his will and pleaſure, and by entreaty, and the Lord being iuſt in giving his thinges, regardeth their worthynes, upon whom he beſtoweth his benefits: whom unleſſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their owne, or an others iuſt dignity shall commende, they can hope for noe good thinge from him. But if a bare foreknowledge of future thinges, shalbe of ſo greate importance, in what eſtimation is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſalvation to be had?</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And noe man was able:</hi> A free confeſsion of the creature, that it is able to doe nothing herein. Let them therefore looke to it, who doe make her a patroneſſe for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves in matters of greater moment. Why then should wee mervayle if noe man underſtandeth any of theſe thinges, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, although the moſt quickwitted of them, but alſo not in the whole Kingdome of the Papiſts, noe not that blaſphemouſly uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Pope himſelfe, with all his Seraphicall Doctours, arrogating to them ſelves the victory of all knowledge, learning, prudence, and wiſdome? Theſe thinges ſurmount all humane sharpenes of witte, leaſt peradventure thou reiect rashly that which shall not pleaſe thoſe our maiſters. And the diſtribution <hi>of thinges in heaven, in earth, and which are under the earth,</hi> may be underſtood fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proclaiming of the Angell; he made enquiry who was
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6819:89"/> worthy? Therfore the inquiſition perteined not to the <hi>Devils, and ſoules pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for ſinnes.</hi> For what hope or shewe of worthynes could be here? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the thinges in Heaven,</hi> are the Angels; <hi>they in the earth,</hi> Men living: <hi>they which are under the earth, are the Saints ſleeping in their graves.</hi> Whom he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth in this manner by that one part, which cometh neerer to our ſenſe. In which reſpect <hi>Iacob</hi> ſayeth, <hi>and I ſhall goe downe to my ſonne mourning into the grave,</hi> Gen. 37.35. In theſe alone their might be ſome queſtion. Therfore that place is to colde for to kindle a <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Nor looke thereon:</hi> for ſo hath Theod. Beza: the common tranſlation hath <hi>looke upon:</hi> I should rather turne, <hi>looke in.</hi> For ſo the ſentence encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: ſeeing this is greater, then not to open. The booke could not be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in, ſo long as it did remaine ſealed: whereupon the addition would be ſuperfluous in this ſenſe.</p>

For this is it wherby <hi>our Prieſt once entring into the holy place, hath obtained eternall redemption:</hi> Heb. 9.12. And in that he hath once gat redemption for the elect, shall he not alſo obtayne all things for us, that may avayle any way for our good? <hi>The ſeaven hornes</hi> is that ſupreame pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, wherby <hi>the man Chriſt</hi> ſitting at the right hande of the <hi>Father,</hi> ruleth and governeth all things according to that, which Chriſt being rayſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, ſayd to his diſciples, <hi>all power is given mee in heaven and in earth.</hi> Mat. 28.18. Therefore that moſt meeke Lambe wanteth not thoſe weapons, wherby he chaſeth away his enemyes, althoug by his great patience he ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth not to regarde the iniuries which they doe. And thou mayeſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, that it is not needfull that the parables and ſimilitudes should agree in all thinges, ſeeing here to the Lambe contrary to nature are attributed <hi>ſeaven hornes</hi> and as many <hi>eyes,</hi> that is, gifts of the Spirit wherewith Chriſt endueth the faithfull. They are ſent from him, ſeeing noe man can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker even of the leaſt gift, unleſſe he beſtowe it on them. For <hi>God heareth not ſinners: but from his fulnes wee all receive: and he being gone to his Father, ſendeth the Conforter unto his, which leadeth them into all trueth,</hi> as in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Iohn chapter ſixteene ver. ſeaventh and thirteene. A viſible token whereof were once the <hi>cloven tongues like fire ſitting upon the Apoſtles, and that miraculous gift of ſpeaking ſuddenly with other tongues</hi> Act. 2.3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>With which faculty not onely the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were endued, but afterward al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo others embracing the faith. Neither are they onely <hi>ſente into all the world,</hi> that they may conferre the comfortable knowledge of ſalvation to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: But that CHRIST may ſearch out all thinges that are done in his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6819:90"/> Church, yea which are done in any other place of the world. Wherefore howe great impudency is it to thruſt upon the Church a viſible head, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>LAMBE</hi> is furnished with ſo many eyes, neither hath them idle and unoccupied, but ſendeth them forth with all diligence into the whole world? The care of Chriſt taketh not indede away the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> eyther <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> or <hi>Politicall,</hi> which he hath ordained: But to faine and invent a newe kinde and degree, and that under a pretence that CHRIST is ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent, is proper onely to that man, who is directly oppoſite to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As touching the wordes; ſome Copies reade, as is noted in the Greeke Bibles lately ſet forth at Frankeford, <hi>which are,</hi> that the relative may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as well to the hornes, as to the eyes. After which manner alſo Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas readeth this verſe. And the <hi>Hornes</hi> may be ſayd to be ſent into the whole world, when CHRIST putteth forth his power in ſuccouring his owne ſervantes, and deſtroying his enemyes.</p>
               <p>But it agreeth more properly to the eyes, which when wee turne toward any thinge, wee are ſayd to caſt them upon the ſame.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And haſt redeemed us;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Beaſts and Elders</hi> are men redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>blood of Chriſt:</hi> neither in deede ſome twelve chiefe men of the Iewes, and as many <hi>Chriſtian twelve Apoſtles,</hi> with the <hi>foure Evangeliſts.</hi> (For this whole company was not choſen <hi>out of every Tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> but out of the nation of the Iewes onely) but of all the faithfull in every place: all which this holy company and bande muſtered indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently from all places of the world, doe worthyly note out, as wee have ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerved upon the fourth verſe of the 4. chapter. And it is ſayd ſignificantly, <hi>out of every Tribe</hi> &amp;c. not <hi>all Tribes</hi> &amp;c. becauſe all men are not redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, but onely the elect, as Aretas hath well obſerved. 10 <hi>And haſt made us to our God Kinges;</hi> Some copies doe reade <hi>them,</hi> &amp; ſo this whole verſe in the third perſon: but Aretas, and the common Latine tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, doe reade in the firſt perſon: wee have expounded theſe thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But why doe they mention this benefite in the cauſe of taking the booke? Becauſe it is proper in deede to a <hi>Kingly</hi> power, to prevayle with God, and to beare away thoſe thinges from him, wherof lately they had

Wherfore they ſing that <hi>they are made Kings to God,</hi> as though they should ſay, that they not onely are Kinges, becauſe they have ſubdued Death, Sinne, and the Devill, but chiefly becauſe they have <hi>God</hi> regarding their commodityes, &amp; keeping nothing from them, which any way may make for their good. This is that Kingly power, moſt noble in deede and alway to be praiſed. But where they ſay, they shall <hi>raigne on earth,</hi> from hence that is evident, which even nowe wee ſaid at the eight verſe, that this is the company of the <hi>militant Church</hi> reigning on earth. For why should the Saints in Heaven having attayned heavenly glory reioyce in an earthly dominion?</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>And I heard round about the Throne and the Beaſts:</hi> The glorifying of the Angels, who apart from the Church prayſe <hi>God,</hi> of whom there is another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men redeemed by the blood of Chriſt: for theſe being fallen are reſtored, and they, are upheld that they fall not.

But where ought to be a greater number, then where every kinde of Creature which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and beneath, with one conſent agree to prayſe the Lambe, ver. 13?

                  <hi>After J beheld when the Lambe had opened the firſt of the ſeales:</hi> Nowe the Spirit entreth into the events, which will inſtruct us touching all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings ſucceeding by courſe in the world, as farre as is expedient for the Church, and which are of any moment, unto the laſt end of all thinges. A great matter and chiefly neceſſary to be knowne: but ſuch as into which noe underſtanding of mortall man can penetrate. Therefore whom in the beginning I have prayed unto, him doe I call upon againe, having gone forward in ſome part by his alone grace, that he will graunte mee happily to make an ende of the thinges that remayne, who hath graunted mee ſo to beginne, as I am perſuaded is agreeing with his trueth. <hi>Thou therfore moſt holy and moſt wiſe Lambe, who alone haſt deſerved to take &amp; unſcale the booke, and not to that ende that thou ſhouldeſt have theſe ſecretes for thy ſelfe alone, but that thou ſhouldeſt communicate them with thy Church, as farre as ſhalbe for her profit, graunt, I pray thee, unto mee thy moſt unworthy ſervant according to thy bounteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that perceaving cleerely what hidden and ſecrete things theſe ſeales conteine, I may reveale the ſame holily unto the world, to the edification of thy Church, the ruine of Antichriſt, and the glory of thine owne name, to be publiſhed unto all ages, Amen.</hi> In that wee have diſtinguished the <hi>Events</hi> into three rankes, wee have the Spirit himſelfe for our authour ioyning the trumpets to the ſeales, &amp; the vials to the trumpets, in ſuch ſorte, as that alwayes the firſt thing of that which followeth, doe aryſe out of the laſt of that which wente before. Therefore they bring in darkenes upon themſelves, who doe thruſt togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one, the ſeales, the trumpets, the vials, and alſo the ſeaven Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtickes, ſo as each one of every order should be ioyned one to another in equall degree, as if the Father &amp; the Sonnes should be equall, &amp; should runne togither the ſame terme of yeeres. Furthermore ſeeing the ſeales ar as it were promiſes of future thinges, the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets adverſities approaching with great noiſe: the vials, things that are powred upon men by little and little, and come upon them unwarres, as wee shall after ſee, &amp; overwhelme
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6819:93"/> them: it ſeemeth not to be convenient, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founde theſe contrary things togither, ſo that the thinge should be promiſed and accomplished all at once: and that the ſame thing should be done openly and ſecretly at the ſame moment of time: but let us come to the wordes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ When he had opened</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one Seale,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the firſt,</hi> as Theod. Beza tranſlateth it: for after followeth, <hi>the ſecond, third,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo the Hebrewes every where uſe to ſpeake. But before I proceede to the thinges that are behinde, that cold comment of the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> is to be removed, who thinketh that the <hi>opening of the booke</hi> is ſomething diverſe from <hi>opening of the ſeales:</hi> as though nothing in the booke could be read and shewed unto us, before that all the ſeales should be opened. Which opinion verily faineth unto us I knowe not what booke, of which wee have received never a word written, neither doe wee underſtand from thence ought touching thinges to come. For the <hi>Revelation</hi> hath nothing more beſides <hi>the opened ſeales</hi> For out of them the <hi>trumpets</hi> come forth, and againe out of them the <hi>vials,</hi> as wee have advertiſed in the reſolution, ſo as all the reſt of the Prophecy is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited with thoſe thinges, that are conteined in the ſeales, as wee shall proove by manifeſt argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in their places. If therfore after all the ſeales opened he hath found out ſome booke to be read, it is Apocryphe that is a hid booke, the originall and authority whereof is not known, &amp; which peradventure may lie hid in the coffer of the breaſt of their <hi>Pope,</hi> but which to reade and knowe the Church hath nothing to doe. Furthermore it is needfull for the clearer underſtanding of the periodes, firſt the termes of time wherein thinges are finished and every ſeverall article of them, to ſet downe ſome entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wee muſt begin: which ſurely wee iudge to be by and by after this writing of <hi>John.</hi> For that ſaying of the fourth chapter ver. 1. <hi>I will ſhew thee the things that muſt be done hereafter,</hi> calleth backe <hi>Iohn</hi> both to that moment of the Revelation given, &amp; alſo teacheth to count from thence all thinges which are delivered in the booke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore there is noe neede to have recourſe unto the firſt ages of the world, nor unto the <hi>Monarchies,</hi> nor unto the times of Chriſt or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, or in any ſuch thinge of the age paſt: but <hi>John</hi> writing this Reve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation by the commaundement of God about the ende of the Empire of Domitian (as Ireneus sheweth in his 5 booke againſt hereſies, &amp; Euſebius out of Ireneus in the 3 booke of his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory chap. 18. At the ende of the raigne of Domitian, about the ninety ſeaventh yeere from the birth of Chriſt) wee thinke the beginning of the <hi>Seales,</hi> to wit of the firſt pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riod is to be ſet at that time, from whence wee shall ſee every ech thing which followeth to flowe with a ready courſe ſtopped and ſtayed with noe

The event in the unfolding will shewe what is the limite of every <hi>Periode.</hi> Theſe things being thus eſtablished, let us returne unto the declaration of the wordes, afterward wee shall ſee the thing it ſelfe and co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>herence thereof. The firſt <hi>preparation</hi> is of the Lambe opening the firſt ſeale. For he is the <hi>word of the Father,</hi> who doth miniſter unto us whatſoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding wee have of Gods will. And the events are called <hi>Seales,</hi> both becauſe they containe a myſtery moſt hidden from the underſtanding of the prophane multitude Iſay 8.16. and alſo becauſe theſe firſt experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts should be pledges of future thinges.

Neither muſt wee thinke that a famine belonging to the common people, is a lighter matter, then that it should be meete that men should be forewarned of it.

In ſome ages coming after, when alſo the famine and peſtilence became worſe and worſe, men were afraid of the dogges, leaſt being accuſtomed to eate their carkaſes caſt forth abroade, afterward they should deſyre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alive for meate: whereupon they ſet themſelves to kill the dogges, Euſeb. booke 9.8. neither could it be, but when foode fayled in the fieldes, and men were leſſe able to defend themſelves, that many were devoured of the Beaſts.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce at any time were there ſo great troupes of <hi>Beaſts</hi> in every place, ſpoiling and renting men in pieces. For when <hi>Gallienus</hi> was Emperour, who after Valerian was taken, reigned alone, ſo many <hi>tyrants</hi> aroſe, who tooke to themſelves the name of <hi>Emperour,</hi> as there were not ſo many ſince <hi>Ceſar was Dictator,</hi> to that time, in ſo long a row and continued ranke of <hi>EMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RS.</hi> Thirty are recorded by <hi>Trebellius,</hi> who at one time, in divers cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6819:100"/> invaded the Empire: in which alſo <hi>certeine women</hi> ſcoffed at the name of Romane. How great a diſmembring of men muſt there needes be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo many Beaſts ſtrove at once about the Empire? Such then are the three <hi>Seales,</hi> every one notable for their ſcourges: the two former for their ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the laſt for all theſe kindes of punishements, wherewith the world was to be punished, for deſpiſing and vexing the trueth. For when the milder correction prevailed nothing with their ſtubburne hartes, almoſt all the hoſtes of death are ſent in upon them, even as alſo the event hath moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved. Neither yet are theſe evills ſo proper to this one age, that they can agree to noe other; but they are the common punishements of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>temners of godlines;</hi> Lev. 26. Ezech. 6.11. &amp;c. And afterward after theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> one may ſee the <hi>Famine and Peſtilence</hi> did conſume all, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Maximinus</hi> raigned in the Eaſt, Euſeb. booke 9. 8. But there is ſo ſolemne a Prophecy of them in this place, both becauſe the next times after Iohn, should be famous for theſe punishements, which men should procure to themſelves for deſpiſing the <hi>Ghoſpell,</hi> and alſo becauſe they should be faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full hoſtages, pledges and ſeales of the future events, that were to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted many ages after.</p>

Furthermore, this <hi>Seale</hi> conſiſted partly in rehearſing thinges paſt, partly in reporting an eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that kinde, which is wont to glaunce by without perceaving: eſpecially ſeeing our natures ar ſo diſpoſed, that adverſities doe abyde more ſurely in our mindes, then proſperityes.

                  <hi>¶ J ſawe under the altar the ſoules:</hi> The fifte type is <hi>the ſoules of the Martyrs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the altar</hi> in this verſe, <hi>requiring vengeance againſt their enemies,</hi> ver. 10 &amp; <hi>receaving anſwere</hi> ver. 11.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6819:101"/> great cruelty of men she contended. Wee have heard in deede <hi>the trueth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming,</hi> wee have learned alſo that <hi>warre, famine, and peſtilence with their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions</hi> poſſeſſed and ſpoiled all thinges, but there was noe mention yet, in what ſtate the true worshippers of Chriſt were in the meane time: all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though from the victory of the trueth, their conflict may be geſſed, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe calamities anoying the world, that great wronge was done to the godly, for which cauſe the enemies were ſo sharpely punished. But the thinge is made manifeſt nowe by this complainte of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> killed, that is to ſay, that an infinite quantity of blood was shed of men that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time in which <hi>John</hi> wrote, unto the ende of the raigne of <hi>Galienus,</hi> whither the former <hi>ſeales</hi> have brought us. And what place is there that have not heard of theſe horrible maſſacres all this ſpace of time? <hi>Tratan, Hadrian, Antonin Ver, Maximin, Severe, Decie &amp;</hi> the reſt, not <hi>Emperours,</hi> but <hi>Murtherers</hi> have defiled all Hiſtories with guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe blood But he that followeth brevity may not recken up ſeverally the innumerable murders. Although who coulde be able to rehearſe them if he would, ſeeing the Miniſters of the wickednes confeſſe themſelves not ſufficient to kill them, that came running togither to punishement of their owne accord. For ſo a certaine man <hi>Tiberianus,</hi> who had the chiefe doing of things at <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> reported to <hi>Traiane,</hi> as <hi>Suidas</hi> declareth in his <hi>Traia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no. Plinie</hi> a heathen man being moved with the multitude of them that were killed, obtained ſome ceaſing, or at leaſt a certaine moderation. So pitifull was the condition of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that the enemyes had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on their calamityes: reade the 3 4.5.6.7 book of Euſebius, where almoſt every page is washed with blood. It is noe mervayle, that the ſaincts being wearied with ſo continuall ſlaughters, doe aske at lenght ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. So is the meaning of this verſe, but the wordes are yet to be made cleare and delivered from the ſlanders of the adverſaries. From whence then is this fetched, <hi>that the ſoules of the Martyrs lye under the Altar?</hi> Without doubt in that r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But it is knowne that the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nacle</hi> both according to the partes, and according to the whole, was a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt. Wherfore to be hidden in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> is to have Chriſt alone for the place of their ſuccour and refuge, by whom alone wee are co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vered and defended againſt all aſſaults of the adverſaries. From hence it is apparant why the <hi>Soules</hi> are ſayd to be under the <hi>Altar,</hi> to wit, that wee
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:6819:101"/> should underſtand firſt from thence, that all the ſalvation alſo of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> conſiſteth in the alone Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under the which the holy cham<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hiding themſelves as under a shielde, can appeare ſafely and boldly be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God; and that they doe not merite eternall life to themſelves by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> shedding of their owne blood for Chriſt his ſake, as the Papiſts wickedly dote: but to have neede of this covering, without which otherwiſe they cannot ſtande in the ſight of Gods maieſty. Secondly that wee may know <hi>that all the children of God muſt be conformable to the image of their firſt borne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Rom. 8.29 and muſt walke the ſame way to heaven, wherein he hath gone before us, that is to ſay, by ſuffering of troubles, being made ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and oblations, and to be killed with many anguishes. For which cauſe Paule ſayth, <hi>that he in his fleſh for the body of Chriſt, doth fulfill the reſt of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,</hi> Col. 1.24. And the reſt or defects he calleth <hi>conformityes,</hi> and not <hi>ſatisfactions,</hi> either of <hi>worthynes or merit.</hi> For whatſoever remaineth yet to be ſuffered of any of the ſaints, that is wanting after a ſorte to the afflictions of Chriſt, who iudgeth all our calamityes his owne. Theſe are common to all the faithfull, who have place alike under the <hi>Altar:</hi> but eſpecially to the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> whoſe ſufferings are famous before the reſt. For which cauſe this covert to hide in, is attributed to them by name. Seeing then they lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the altar in this ſenſe, after the uſuall ſpeaking in the ſcriptures, howe wickedly doth the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> wreſt theſe wordes unto the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them, of dedicating Temples? Whoſe manner is to bury the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes or reliques of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> under the altar in the Churches, which they dedicate to them: &amp; afterward to call the Church by his name, whoſe reliques are there buried, as though more reſpect were to be had to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques under the altar, then of him whom they will have to be ſacrificed on the altar. Would the <hi>Spirit</hi> have reſpect to this cuſtome, wherby very great iniury is done both to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and alſo to his <hi>holy Martyrs?</hi> To <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe he is ſpoiled of his honour, and thruſt beneath his ſervants. To <hi>Martyrs,</hi> becauſe they are made robbers of his glory, for maintayning whereof they shed their blood. Neither are the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> content to abuſe theſe wordes unto the defence of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> unleſſe alſo they deſtroy that which was well built of others. <hi>Bernard in his third ſermon of the Saints,</hi> taught from hence, <hi>the holy ſoules looſed from this priſon of the body, not forthwith to enioy perfite bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but to waite for full happines at the laſt iudgement, reioycing in the meane time with great and huge comfort:</hi> I diſpute not howe ſuch doctrine is not drawne neceſſarily from this place: the ſentence ſeemeth to be true and agreable with the other ſcriptures. For ſo David ſpeaketh, <hi>when J awake, I ſhalbe ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thy image,</hi> Pſal. 17.15. Neither did <hi>Paule expect a crowne before that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6819:102"/> day, in which it ſhalbe given to all that have loved the bright comming of Chriſt;</hi> 2. Tim. 4.8. Neither would God that <hi>the auncient people ſhould be made perfite without us:</hi> much leſſe is it like to be true, that one of the eſſentiall parts, should attaine abſolute happines without the other, <hi>Heb. 11.40.</hi> They that would (more boldly then becometh modeſt Chriſtians) that the ſeparate ſoules, should have a cleare ſight of <hi>God,</hi> in whom as in a glaſſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde all thinges, <hi>paſt, preſent, and to come:</hi> what reaſon doe they give, why the ſoules under the <hi>ALTAR</hi> not content with this ſight alone, as if they were ignorant doe enquire of the time of vengeance? Many ſuch thinges ought to have reſtrained the Ieſuites not to fight againſt a true ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. But they ſawe that unleſſe they should give to the ſeparated ſoules full happines in the cleare beholding of God, <hi>the Jnvocating of Saints</hi> would be overthrowne, and that there were no reaſon left, for to shewe why wee should implore their aide, ſeeing it was not the manner before Chriſt was exhibited: but let it be ſufficient to have touched in a word their crafty dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For the word of God:</hi> Which moſt conſtantly they have profeſſed &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched, as ch. 1.9. And for the teſtimony which they maintained, in the greek <hi>which they had,</hi> peradventure in this ſenſe, that they were counted Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by the teſtimony of others, as 1 Tim. 3.7. <hi>But he muſt be well reported, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them that are without:</hi> as if <hi>for the word of God,</hi> should belonge to them, who by their profeſsion have procured to themſelves the hatred of the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked: but <hi>the teſtimony which they had,</hi> to them that are manifeſted by the iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement of other men.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>They cryed with a lowde voice:</hi> Hitherto the firſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, which hath ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned the condition of the time paſt: nowe the preſent ſtate under <hi>Galienus,</hi> is shewed by a cry. Through yrkeſomnes of continuall trouble, a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from it at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth is asked; ſeeing they have endured more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enough. This cry sheweth the manner of Gods iuſtice, which cannot ſuffer uniuſt murders unpunished: in which ſorte <hi>the blood of Abell is ſayd to have cryed,</hi> Gen. 4.10. But how great is the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our God, which is provoked by a cry to punishement, before that he prepares to it? But whither did the ſaints beare the former iniuries without ſpeaking, neither cryed out before this 5 ſeale? Without doubt they did alwayes ſigh under the croſſe: but nowe firſt of all mention is made of the crying, becauſe the time was not farre of when they should be delivered from thoſe ſorrowes. For God is wont when he will beſtowe any thing upon his children, to ſtirre up their harts to fervent prayers, both that they may more eſteeme the good thing obtained, and alſo that they may learne howe great a regard he hath of us
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:6819:102"/> that call upon him with ſincere mindes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ How long O Lord which art holy &amp; true:</hi> They ſet forth <hi>God</hi> with thoſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, wherby they may ſtablish &amp; increaſe their faith, as it ought to be done in all right invocation. For becauſe <hi>he is holy,</hi> he cannot let goe unpunished the ill deedes of the world, eſpecially ſeeing he is alſo <hi>true</hi> &amp; hath made lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge promiſes touching the bleſſednes of his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Doeſt thou not iudge &amp; avenge:</hi> Iudgement perteineth to the knowledge of a matter, vengeance to the performing &amp; executing of the thing iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which ſignify punishement toward him that doth wronge: yet chiefly I thinke <hi>the delivering of the innocent party:</hi> from whence it is conſtrued often with a prepoſition, as in Luke <hi>avenge mee of my adverſary,</hi> ch. 18.3. Where the widowe doth not ſo much deſire fervently the punishement of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, as her owne deliverance. So David 1 Sam. 13. <hi>and the Lord avenge mee of thee,</hi> ſo hath Tremelius. I would rather tranſlate the wordes thus, <hi>&amp; the Lord ſhall deliver mee from thee,</hi> as alſo the Greeke Interpreters have it, <hi>the Lord deliver mee from thee:</hi> for he doth not wish evill to <hi>Saul</hi> to his face. And ſuch a thing is it which the <hi>Soules</hi> require, to wit, that God at length would after ſo long a tryall, deliver the <hi>Church</hi> from the power &amp; tyranny of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, &amp; that he would not ſuffer it to be oppreſſed alway with the yoke of the wicked. That this is the ſumme of the requeſt, it is knowne from the graunt. That is not denyed them which they deſire earneſtly, but it is differ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to ſome time, which being accomplished, they should receive the thing ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Then longe white robbes were given to every one:</hi> Montanus omitteth the white robes, &amp; readeth, <hi>&amp; it was given to them that they ſhould reſt.</hi> Other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies reade in the ſingular number thus, <hi>&amp; a white robe was given them;</hi> &amp; ſo A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>retas &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tranſlation, <hi>&amp; there were given to them every one ſeverall white robes.</hi> The anſwere made to the ſoules is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by a <hi>ſigne</hi> &amp; by a <hi>ſpeech,</hi> by both which is declared what should be the next co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſaints.

But whereas the <hi>robes are white,</hi> that perteineth to an orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t uſed in time of ioy, as wee hav shewed at ch. 3.4.

                  <hi>Traiane to Gallienus?</hi> Chriſt promiſed that <hi>he that overcometh ſhalbe clothed in white aray</hi> ch. 3.5. How long is this promiſe differred? It is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, but that the race being runne out, there is ſome reward of the labour.

The Hiſtory witneſſeth, that the thing fell out after the ſame manner. For after <hi>Galienus,</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Claudius, Quin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tilius, Aurelianus, Tacitus, Florianus, Probus, Carus and his ſonnes,</hi> &amp; at length <hi>Diocletian:</hi> through all which ſpace of about fourty yeeres, unto the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinth yeere of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> there was a time of a white gowne, and of ioyfull mirth, free from the murders and ſpoiling of the ſaints, the <hi>Emperours</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being reſtrained of <hi>God,</hi> that they might not interrupte and hinder the peace graunted. Which calmnes Euſeb. deſcribeth eloquently in the 8. booke and 1. and 2. chap. of his Hiſt. For being about to write of the ſorrowfull time of <hi>Diocletians</hi> cruelty, he prepareth him ſelfe a way, by the remembrance of the former happines. He profeſſeth himſelfe unable to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clare according to the worthines of the thing, howe great every where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all men was the credit and liberty of the Chriſtian trueth: <hi>Howe great was the mildnes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the Emperours towards ours, to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted authority and rule over the Gentiles? whom they ſuffered without puniſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and bouldly to profeſſe their religion, held in great eſtimation, loved entirely, and coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted moſt truſty to them, as that Dorotheus and Gregorius.

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany of people, the accuſtomed houſes were not able to receive the multitude, but it was needfull to build newe and larger.</hi> Certenly the whole narration caſteth a ſavour of mirth moſt convenient to theſe white robes: neither is there neede of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other comment and expoſition of theſe garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and of that reſt, which the holy ſoules are commanded to take. But this felicity remained uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, untill <hi>Diocletian</hi> diſturbed it. For this one onely conflict was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning to their fellowe ſervants, which at length being paſt, they should enioy the thinge much deſired: neither should any rage of Tyrants after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble them, as before times.</p>

As touching that, <hi>Aretas</hi> reporteth from the monuments of <hi>Andreas,</hi> that very many ſayd, <hi>that this earthquake was a paſſage from the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, which were brought upon them for Chriſt his ſake, unto the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> And ſo the ſcriptures are wont to call ſome notable alteration, an earthquake, as where it is ſayd: <hi>yet once more I will ſhake the earth,</hi> Heb. 12.26. It ſignifyeth the remooving of thoſe thinges that are shaken, as Saint Paul declareth. And in the olde Teſtament, <hi>the going of the children of Jſraell out of Egipt, is called an earthquake,</hi> as Pſal. 68.9. <hi>The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the preſence of God.</hi> Thoſe Interpreters have touched the point according to the trueth, but onely they did miſſe in this, that living under Antichriſt, they expected him yet to come, not knowing that he was come longe a goe. Which errour of the auncient Fathers (as who being further of from the laſt event, were leſſe able to perceive the matter it ſelfe) the Papiſts ſnatch to themſelves greedily: and here they make a very great gaping and diſtance of time, leaping over from the times of <hi>Traiane,</hi> in which they conclude the former <hi>Seales,</hi> unto the laſt ende of the world, which they reſerve to their <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as though by this earthquake, all iudgement of that which is right had fallen unto them. But whether is it likely that a whole thouſand and five hundred yeeres, and yet to come, wee knowe not how many more, have bin paſſed over with ſilence, and that all the reſt of the Prophecy was ſtuffed togither into the narrow ſtraites of 3. yeeres and an halfe, as <hi>Fraunces of Ribera the Jeſuite</hi> will have it? It is indeede a profitable abridgement and a short way to ſet free his <hi>Lord the Pope</hi> from a very great feare. For it could not be, but as often as he should beholde his face in this glaſſe, he would ſeeme to himſelfe to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> unleſſe the Ieſuite now did make it apparant, that all that, was but a phantaſme which made him afraid. That nothing is here ſpoken of the preſent time, neither of that which is paſt through many ages, but that all the ſpeech following, is of the time yet to come. But wee will put away this ſmoke &amp; miſt <hi>through Gods his helpe,</hi> neither will wee ſuffer that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſeeming
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:6819:104"/> to himſelfe a trikſy felow, should love himſelfe to deſtruction: &amp; alſo will make playne, that the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> doe not interprete but moke the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>¶ <hi>And the Sunne became blacke:</hi> Theſe figurative and hyperbolicall ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doe shewe that there should be a perſecution, the moſt fierce of all thoſe which the Church endured at any time from Chriſts birth till nowe. For ſo the Prophetes are wont to ſpeake when they pointe at any great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, as Iſaiah, <hi>He will clothe the heavens with blacknes, he will make their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering as a ſacke cloath,</hi> chap. 50.3. And Ieremy, <hi>When I beholde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vens, they have noe light,</hi> ch. 4.23. <hi>and the heavens above ſhalbe blacke</hi> ver. 28. but moſt playnly in Ezechiell, ſpeking of the overthrowe of the Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>When I ſhall put thee out, I will cover the heavens and make the ſtarres thereof darke; I will cover the Sunne with a cloude, and the moone ſhall not make her light to ſhine: all the cleare lights in the heaven I will make darke upon thee, and bring darkenes upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy land, ſaith the Lord,</hi> ch. 32.7.8. Many ſuch places doe teach, that theſe ſpeeches are not to be refferred to the laſt iudgement onely, as ſome doe expounde, but alſo to other times: which thoſe auncients did ſee, of whom ſpake Aretas even now, who would have theſe thinges to be underſtood of the paſsing over to <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> This blacknes of the <hi>Sunne</hi> &amp; the other diſturbance of the <hi>creature,</hi> perteineth to that horrible ſlaughter, wherby thoſe wicked men <hi>Diocletian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximinian</hi> endevoured to roote out the Church. For wee shall ſee that the <hi>Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne</hi> &amp; <hi>Moone</hi> doth note ſtably through this booke, the chiefe ornaments of the congregation of the faithfull: ſo that the <hi>Sunne</hi> may ſignify the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Moone</hi> that <hi>excellent glory of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi> wherby the ſaincts doe shine, after they have borrowed light fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That both theſe should be miſerably defyled by this common calamity, this ſeale sheweth it. The accomplishement whereof is recited by Euſebe, booke 8.2. For when the <hi>Emperours</hi> in the nineteenth yeere of their reigne, ordained by publik decrees, that the bookes of the holy ſcriptures should be committed to the fire in the middes of the marked: <hi>wee ſawe,</hi> ſayth Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, <hi>with theſe very eyes, that the ſacred Scriptures, inſpired of God, were caſt in to the fire, in the middes of the market place:</hi> and in the ſame place a little after, <hi>the Kinges letters patents did fly to &amp; fro in every place, wherby it was commaunded to aboliſh the ſcriptures.</hi> So this <hi>Sunne</hi> as a ſacke cloath of haire noteth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely generally, that the publicke ioy should be turned into very great ſor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row, but alſo eſpecially that outragiouſnes, wherby cruelty was exerciſed againſt the ſacred ſcriptures. Neither could it be otherwiſe, but when the fountaine of light was darkened, the <hi>Moone</hi> which hath her light onely borrowed, should fade away into the darke colour of blood, as almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye it happeneth, when shee is kept from having ſociety with the Sunne.</p>

Of which thing the <hi>Spirit</hi> maketh mention, in ſo fine a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, that the faithfull being forwarned, should not be diſcouraged with the ſo eaſy falling away of many. Euſebius sheweth that the thing fell out altogither as it was here foreshewed. For after that firſt decree of demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the temples &amp; burning the ſcriptures, there was added an other not long after of <hi>apprehending the Paſtors of the Churches, and compelling them to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Jdoles:</hi> Here many courageouſly perſevering, were not overcome with torments, but an infinite ſorte of others, being aſtonied a good while before through feare, were weakened at the firſt aſſault, Euſeb. booke 8.2. by the which he sheweth the ſudden fall of many.</p>

Theſe thinges therefore prove <hi>that the calamity reſted not in the Governours alone, but that the whole face of the Church was covered with ſo blacke darkenes, that it could be ſeene almoſt no where.</hi> Let the ſame Euſeb. be read in the 3 booke ch. 3. where he bewayleth the miſerable waſting of it, with lamentings borrowed from the lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Ieremy, chap. 2.1.2. Likewiſe from Pſal. 89.39 &amp;c. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this deſolation should be but as <hi>the foulding of a booke.</hi> A booke is not deſtroyed when it is rolled up, but remaineth as great as it was before, it becometh indeede leſſe evident and apparant in the ſight, being redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and brought into a farre ſtraighter roome: So likewiſe the <hi>Church</hi> should looſe nothing of her ſyncerity, howſoever her glory might ſeeme to be quite abolished.

                  <hi>¶ And all mountaines and Ilands:</hi> There is nothing ſo firme, which this tempeſt should not remoove, nothing ſo farre of, whither it should not goe and be ſpred. The word <hi>mountaine</hi> noteth that, and the word <hi>Iland,</hi> this. It is a great ſtorme, which doth either ſcatter the little hilles of the earth, or which doth rage but in the bordering and lowe places: but that which doth either caſt and drive away the <hi>Mountaines themſelves,</hi> neither ſtayeth in the continent, but alſo flyeth over the ſea into the Ilandes, muſt needes bring extreame deſtruction. Euſebius beginning this boyſterous ſtorme at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> purſued it by the very footeſteppes through all <hi>Syria, Aegypt, Cappadocia, Cilara and Phrygia;</hi> booke 8. but being as it were wearie with travayling, and loathing ſo ſorrowfull a narration, he came not to our Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rope: although <hi>Thracia, Italy, Spayne, France</hi> being nigh to them, and our <hi>Iland Britanny</hi> ſomewhat further of, miniſtred noe leſſe plenty of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> although the moderation of <hi>Conſtans,</hi> cauſed all things to be more milde in theſe countries.

Neither without cauſe doth Ignatius cry out, <hi>o wonderfull thing and unknowne till this age, that of their owne accord, neither old age preſſing them, nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the weightines of things, both brought themſelves into order.</hi> Euſeb. layeth the cauſe upon their phreneſy. Nicephorus alſo upon their rage, aryſing doubt leſſe from thence, becauſe they ſawe that they laboured ſore in vayne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But they touched not the true cauſe: from hence they should have learned this, which is it and noe other: <hi>The Lambe</hi> at length shewing himſelfe to be the avenger of his Church, inwardly and ſecretly did ſtinge their mindes with the conſcience of their wickednes, and feare of vengeance: wherby he drove theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> even againſt their wills unto this unheard modeſty. The thing is manifeſt from Maximianus, who, after that ſtinge of conſcience waxed ſomewhat weake, it repented him of his fact, and left no meanes unattented, for to recover the ſcepter which he had laid downe. An other of the <hi>Emperours,</hi> who ſucceeded thoſe that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve over their place called <hi>Gallerius Maximianus</hi> exerciſing tyranny againſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the ſame <hi>Lambe</hi> vanquished by an horrible diſeaſe, and drove him to recantation: an exemple whereof ſee in Euſeb. booke 18.17.

               <p n="16">16 <hi>And they ſayd to the Mountaines:</hi> It is an argument of exceeding deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when they eſteemed all evill but light in compariſon of his wrath, from which they would redeeme themſelves with any moſt grievous dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage whatſoever. <hi>Diocletian</hi> being ſent for by the letters of <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> drunke poiſon for feare. <hi>Maximianus</hi> ended his life with an haltar. <hi>Gallerius</hi> perished of a moſt fowle diſeaſe. <hi>Maximinus</hi> prevented the death that was nigh to him from <hi>Licinius,</hi> by a voluntary death. <hi>Maxentius</hi> tooke

                  <hi>¶ Foure Angels:</hi> Theſe are not the foure <hi>Angels</hi> of the laſt time, which is yet to come a little before the ende of the world. For their endevour in holding backe the winde goeth a little before the ſealing, as the next words make playne. But they that are ſealed muſt reigne a thouſand yeeres on earth, and thoſe not reaching to the ende by ſome ages, as wee will shew by the helpe of God at the twentith chap. ver. 4. But it grieveth me to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo often with this Ieſuiticall Monſter: that I may make short, if every verſe almoſt doe not diſprove this expoſition, let it obtaine what authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it can. More over neither are theſe good <hi>Angels,</hi> when as that which they entrepriſe perteineth rather to the deſtruction of ſoules, then of bodyes. Certenly the prohibition doth not altogither take from them the power of hurting, but reſtraineth it onely for a time, till the ſealing was finished, which is apparant to have ben done, before that the <hi>Trumpets</hi> doe blowe. Wherefore they rush in togither with the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> being already prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bring in trouble, and ſtayed onely with the let of ſealing: aſſoone as that should be diſpatched, they should fly greedily upon that, from which they would not refrayne themſelves, unleſſe they had ben conſtrained. Therefore both they doe bring thoſe foure miſchiefes which ar threathed by the foure firſt <hi>trumpets,</hi> and alſo unhappy and pernitious effectors of ſo
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:6819:108"/> ſorrowfull events. They may be shewed by name from thoſe <hi>Trumpets,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Firſt</hi> may be called <hi>Contention,</hi> the <hi>ſecond, Ambition,</hi> the <hi>third Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy,</hi> the <hi>fourth, Warre.</hi> Theſe foure <hi>Angels</hi> did take to themſelves the foure corners of the earth, ech one being ready from their ſtations to bring in that miſchiefe, which in the next wordes is mentioned. For aſſoone as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranquility appeared, when nowe <hi>Diocletian</hi> was driven away, and the other Tyrants: the Bishops began forthwith to be given exceedingly to privie diſcords. What meanes aſſayed not <hi>Conſtantine the Greate</hi> to quench this raiſing flame, who appointed a Synode at <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanded Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades and Marcus to ſit in examination of the controverſy againſt Caeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia? But when the Synode was not able to ende the ſtrife, he appointed for chiefe doer in the ſame buſineſſe <hi>Aurelius Biſhop of Syracuſe:</hi> whom togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his fellowes in office, he commanded to goe from the Citie <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> in France, and the matter being heard againe, to ſet them at one, that were at variance. The counter-writings of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> touching this thing are to be ſeen in Euſeb. booke 10. 5. The <hi>Antichriſtian ambition</hi> ſprung up in the times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> leaſt wee should thinke that it fayled nowe in playing her part: <hi>But now,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>you knowe what letteth, that he ſhould be revealed in his time, for the myſtery of iniquity worketh already.</hi> 2 Theſſal. 2.6. And ſurely one would ſcarce beleeve, but that thoſe arrogant boaſtings of <hi>the Chaire of Rome,</hi> with which the <hi>Decretall Epiſtles</hi> doe abounde, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of the poſterity, and afterward to have bin aſcribed falſly to the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, ſo impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and vaine are they, unleſſe <hi>Firmilianus</hi> had proved, that they are their owne, at leaſt for a great part, whoſe names they beare. For ſpeaking of <hi>Stephanus then Biſhop of Rome, He that ſo boaſteth,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>of the place of his Biſhoprike, and avoucheth that he holdeth ſucceſſion from Peter, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon whom the foundations of the Church are ſet,</hi> shewing playne enough, how the <hi>Biſhops</hi> then were given to boaſting, amonge the Epiſtles of Cyprian, Epiſt. 75. This ſame age was famous by the beginning of the <hi>Hereſy of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> whom wee have ſayd to be the <hi>third Angell.</hi> Neither was the <hi>Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Barbarouſnes,</hi> which had brought longe agoe the Romanes under the yoke, quiet in thoſe times, as may be ſeen in Euſeb. upon the life of Conſt. booke 4. Albeit that in ſtirring they prevayled not: yet there wanted not a deſire to troble the ſtate, that wee may eaſily now acknowledg the pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe foure <hi>Angels.</hi> And they did in ſuch ſorte divide the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, that <hi>Contention</hi> did invade with force from the <hi>Eaſt; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> from <hi>the Weſt; Hereſy</hi> from <hi>the South: Warre</hi> from <hi>the North:</hi> the chiefe quarters of the world being ſo occupyed, that the holes out of which the vitall winde should iſſue, were altogither ſtopped fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, as shall be made more playne in his place.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:6819:108"/>
               <p>¶ <hi>Holding the foure windes of the earth:</hi> Wee have ſeene the <hi>Angels</hi> &amp; their ſtandings, their <hi>endevour</hi> is <hi>to take away the winde from the earth: the foure,</hi> ſaith Iohn, <hi>windes of the earth,</hi> which yet is one by nature, but divers according to the countryes from whence it bloweth. But this winde is not properly to be underſtood, ſeeing ſuch a calamity hath never befallen, albeit many ages now are paſt, ſince this Prophecy was accomplished. For if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per, howe should not the ſtopping up hurt as well the ſealed, as the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, who dwelt togither and one with an other? I therefore underſtand the winde, to be the force and faculty of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth to <hi>the winde,</hi> Iohn 3.8. <hi>the winde,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>bloweth whither it liſted, ſo is every one that is borne of the Spirit.</hi> For as of olde that diſordered <hi>Chaos,</hi> and ſeed of this our world could not otherwiſe conſiſt, then as it was quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>of the Spirit, who moved himſelfe upon the waters,</hi> Gen. 1.2. So neither doth this <hi>earth</hi> nor <hi>ſea,</hi> nor <hi>trees</hi> come to the feeling of any vitall ſtrength, unleſſe that ſanctifying winde doth lye upon them, from whoſe breathing they doe as it were drawe their life. It is not indeede in the power of any creatu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re to reſtraine the force of the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly <hi>Spirit:</hi> yet the trueth being ſtopped, which he uſed as his chariot, not without cauſe the paſſages may be ſayd to be ſtopped, wherby he should blowe to our good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ That the winde ſhould not blow upon the earth, nor upon the ſea</hi> &amp;c. Nowe the thinges are reckoned up, from which they would had reſtrayned the winde: to wit, from the <hi>Earth, the Sea, the Trees. The Earth</hi> before, were the <hi>Heathen Nations,</hi> as chap. 6.4.15. Afterward it ſeemeth to ſignify al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, <hi>not men wholy repugnant to the name of Chriſt, but the common ſorte, &amp; mixt company of the corrupt Church, which hath ſucceeded in the place of the Gentiles,</hi> as chap. 8.13. &amp; 12.9.12.13.16. &amp; 13.11. &amp;c. The <hi>Sea</hi> ſignifyeth, <hi>the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> ſometime <hi>true,</hi> and then it is placed before the <hi>Throne</hi> within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas of the <hi>Elders,</hi> where it is of <hi>glaſſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>like to Chryſtall,</hi> moſt cleare &amp; moſt pure, as chap. 4.6. More often it is brought to shew <hi>falſe doctrine,</hi> in which ſenſe, it reſteth and is quiet as in his channell, in the boſome and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this <hi>earth,</hi> which it doth faſten togither with his humidity, though groſſe and brinish, through ſecret paſſages, leaſt being by nature eaſy to be reduced in powder, and not cleaving togither, it should be diſſolved through her atidity. For unleſſe there were ſome bande of conſent amonge the counterfeit citizens, even the wicked aſſemblyes could not ſtande. The <hi>trees</hi> wee underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be <hi>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:6819:109"/> not indeed of the baſeſt ſorte, &amp; condition, but who shewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves above others with their high dignityes, and lift up their heades among the reſt, being more famous in the <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblyes.</hi> But if the <hi>Angels</hi> would have hurt onely this <hi>earth, ſea and trees,</hi> why was there not free leave graunted them? Becauſe in that vile heape many of the elect lay hidden, who were to be provided for: for their ſakes the <hi>Angell from the Eaſt</hi> would have the confuſed multitude to be ſpared, neither any hurt to be done to any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till order was taken for them for whom it was neceſſary. <hi>The wicked gaine the deferring of puniſhment for thoſe fewe good, whom they have dwelling among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ¶ And I ſawe an other Angell which was come up from the Eaſt:</hi> in greeke <hi>which did aſcend:</hi> ſome copyes doe reade <hi>coming up:</hi> the Hebrewes figuratively doe take theſe wordes <hi>to aſcende and deſcende,</hi> for <hi>to departe, to goe forth, to goe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> as <hi>he went up from Ieruſalem,</hi> that is, <hi>he returned and left of to aſſault it,</hi> 2. King. 12.18. But it is well ioyned with the ryſing of the Sunne, becauſe the Sunne ſeemeth to aſcende from the Eaſt, untill he be come to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of heaven. The firſt occaſion of ſealing being declared, there is now deſcribed by what <hi>Miniſter</hi> it was done. Whom both the reſpect of the time and all circunſtances doe proove to have ben <hi>Conſtantine the Great.</hi> He ſucceeded in the Empire, after that the <hi>Lambe had thruſt out Diocletian, and the other Jdolatrous Tyrants.</hi> But <hi>he came up</hi> from the riſing of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving come from the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> countryes to receive the Empyre. For being a yong man he ſerved in warre under <hi>Diocletian</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> But after his vertu had procured him envy, ſo as often through ſecret trecheries he was in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of his life, he was compelled to get himſelfe out of the Eaſt as ſpeedily as he could: and to goe to his Father. So Euſebius writeth <hi>he was provoked to flight for his ſafety:</hi> in the life of <hi>Conſtantin</hi> orat. 1. <hi>Zonaras</hi> ſaith that he was given of his father for an hoſtage <hi>to Galerius,</hi> of whom when he ſawe that he was hated through envy, and that in the battell at <hi>Sarmatia</hi> he was caſt forth of ſet purpoſe to danger, and againe for the ſame intente commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to fight with a Lion (both which battells he executed with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) by flight at length he eſcaped away to his <hi>Father:</hi> &amp; togither alſo by theſe meanes avoided the danger and obtayned his Fathers Empire, the ſeate whereof afterward he placed at <hi>Bizantium.</hi> Therefore whether wee reſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pect his firſt returne from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> or minde the decrees which after the Empire was eſtablished, touching the worshipping of the true <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did fly often from thence into that part of the world that was under <hi>Rome:</hi> the Hiſtory agreeth very well with the Prophecy: but that former ſeemeth to come nigher to the meaning of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> becauſe of thoſe thinges that follow.</p>

For example, let there be drawne a Geometricall figure, whoſe lines are in every parte alike diſtant one from another, whoſe shorter ſide is one foote longe, divided into twelve partes: the other ſide a thouſande feete longe, whoſe voide ſpace conteineth this number: ſurely the figure shall ſeeme to be almoſt of noe breadth, but the ſides being ſevered by ſo ſmall a diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, will make a certaine shewe of lines coincident and meeting togither.

But yet this whole number was not ſealed at once &amp; togither, in the time that <hi>Conſtantine liveth</hi> on the earth, but figuratively one part is here put for the whole, upon whoſe firſt fruites onely the marke was ſet, whereas the reſt in courſe of time should be ſealed, every one according to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their age, as wee ſayd at the former verſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation:</hi> The <hi>Elder</hi> did aske two thinges, <hi>Who are theſe and whence came they:</hi> Iohn is ignorant of both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Which albeit they ſtrike a certen horrour into men, even by the wordes rehearſed, yet they ſcarſe touch the leaſt parte of thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, wherewith the moſt wretched nation is waſted by the ſpace of a thou ſand ſixe hundred yeeres, even to this very day: which times I doubt not but <hi>Moſes</hi> hath shewed in thoſe wordes, that I may put you in minde of this by the way. Who can number by counting, howe great evils thoſe aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jewes,</hi> who killed the <hi>Lord of life,</hi> and defiled their handes with the blood of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſuffered in the deſtruction of the city? Noe Hiſtory sheweth that there was ever made ſo horrible a ſlaughter. The enemy him ſelfe refrained not from teares, acknowledging the ſtrange murders bey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond the cruelty of any warre. You might thinke that the whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was here deſtroyed utterly, eſpecially, when they who were left in that utter rui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, were ſolde to be <hi>ſlaves,</hi> were throwne to the <hi>wilde Beaſts,</hi> were made mocking ſtockes in the <hi>theaters:</hi> finally were not exempted from death, but reſerved unto torment. Indeede a fewe yeeres after it ſeemed to have ben revived, but it was to endure newe calamityes, like as in the Comedie, the heart of Prometheus being eaten, was reſtored often times. For Hadrian killing againe this people moſt miſerably, forbade them their native ſoyle, and diſperſed them into all quarters of the world. Since that time they are diſperſed, vacabondes, banished from their owne country &amp; land, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring through the whole world: without <hi>Governour,</hi> without <hi>God</hi> for a <hi>King:</hi> yea, that I may uſe the wordes of Terlullian in his Apologet. <hi>to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not ſo much permitted, as that according to the right of ſtrangers they may ſalute their Fathers land with their feete.</hi> There was never noe calamity of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eyther for the kinde of puniſhment ſo grievous, or for the length of time of ſuch continuance: there hath not ben any ſpectacle ſo cleare of God being offended: not any ſo fearfull exemple of his eternall wrath.
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:6819:114"/> Neither yet should there beleſſe trouble a little before that time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God shall give an ende to this ſo long miſery. <hi>At that time,</hi> ſaith Daniell, <hi>when there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as hath not ben, ſince it was anation, even unto that time:</hi> which, that it is to be underſtood of the laſt sharpe aſſault before the full reſtoring of the nation, wee shall ſometime shewe more clearely, if God will. Therefore whether wee reſpect the preſent caſting of of this people, or that future calamity, at their receiving againe into grace, this <hi>great affliction</hi> is proper to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who togither with the remnants of the Gentiles, being revived after the tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and with them which shall then firſt open their eyes to ſee the truth, shall make that <hi>great company,</hi> which noe man could number, ver. 9. Theſe thinges are confirmed from that happines, which followeth in the next wordes, which perteineth to this preſent life on earth, &amp; not to that future in the Heavens, the ſound fruition whereof shall not come, before that there be made one <hi>ſheepfolde,</hi> the elect Iewes being choſen into one Chriſtian people, as wee shall ſhewe at chap. 21.22. From which it is nowe manifeſt, ſeeing that this <hi>indefinite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber</hi> is made partly of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> partly of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whoſe calling ought to be expected a longe time after that ſealing, which was ſpoken of before, that thoſe definite and ſealed ones were not Iewes. Furthermore ſound peace and all perfite happines shall follow the calling of the Iewes, as in the next wordes it is declared briefly, but more largely at chap. 21. and 22. But when the <hi>ſealing</hi> was finished, there remained yet much of that <hi>great affliction.</hi> All which shall more appeare in the thinges that follow.</p>

But in that place is underſtood the abolishing of the ceremonies, which they shall regarde no more for the worshipping of God thereby: here is a <hi>pilgri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mage yet on earth from the Lord,</hi> where we have neede of the coming between of outward meanes for to worshippe him: of which there shalbe noe uſe in the heavens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ They ſhall hunger no more:</hi> They shall wante nothing, neither shall any adverſity trouble them, which is ſignifyed by hunger and thirſt; moreover alſo all cauſes of calamityes shalbe driven farre away: <hi>the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne shall not burne

               <p n="17">17 <hi>For the Lambe that is in the middes of the Throne ſhall governe them.</hi> Now the cauſe is rehearſed of the former happines, to every part of which it is diſtributed conveniently; <hi>ſhall governe,</hi> anſwereth to thoſe wordes, shall not hunger: <hi>ſhall lead them to the lively fountaines of waters,</hi> reſpecteth the thirſt, which he ſaid should be ſufferred no more: <hi>and ſhall wipe away all teares,</hi> hath regarde to the heate of the Sunne, which he promiſeth shall not be trobel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome afterward.</p>

For <hi>Maxentius</hi> being overcome at Rome by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Maxentius</hi> in the Eaſt by <hi>Licinius,</hi> howe glad a day appeared to the Church through the whole world? Howe great dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, howe great ioy, howe great triumphe was ther of all degrees?

Neither onely to have theſe thinges, but alſo an <hi>Emperour,</hi> of which never any man before did ſo much as dreame, who endevoured exceedingly to adorne by all meanes that he could, every one of the meaneſt that was named a Chriſtian.

See Aurelius Victor of Ceſar. part 2. Euſeb. booke 10. 8. 9. and upon the life of Conſtantine booke 1. to the ende &amp; beginning of the ſecond.

               <p>But the parts of this <hi>Periode</hi> are diſtinguished by <hi>Trumpets,</hi> becauſe theſe events should be more notable, more famous and manifeſt to all men, and as it were ſung with the publike and lowde voice of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> In receaving of which, there is a certen preparation before they beginne the worke it ſelfe, becauſe by and by after the ſilence made, there should be given ſome token of the troubles to come, before the rage should waxe hotte and be kindled.

               <p>Furthermore this heaven is the <hi>Holy Church</hi> on earth: the <hi>Altar</hi> the more inward holy place of the ſame, the Miniſtery of the High Prieſt, which the <hi>Angels</hi> properly ſo called doe never execute: but the trueth of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the type unto men onely, who have a nature fit for ſacrifice, about which thing the office of the <hi>Prieſt</hi> is chiefly occupied: of which nature ſeeing the <hi>Angels</hi> are voide, neither can they repreſente the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Neither any where in the ſcriptures are theſe dutyes attributed to them.

                  <hi>¶ That he might offer with the prayers:</hi> Theſe thinges are ſpoken according to the auncient cuſtome <hi>of the Temple:</hi> where the <hi>Prieſt</hi> burning incenſe within upon the golden altar, in the meane time the whole people taryed without, giving themſelves to prayer, as in Luke 1.10. <hi>And the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude of the pepple prayed without in the time of the burning incenſe:</hi> from whence it cometh to paſſe, that it is ſayd in this place to be <hi>give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the prayers:</hi> which before time was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be ioyned togither with them at the ſame mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

For could it otherwiſe be, but that the ſyncere mindes ſeeing <hi>ſtrifes, privie grudges, and contentions</hi> raigne every where, and to conſume all things (I meane thoſe which wee shewed even nowe to have followed the halfe houre ſilence) should not ſtrive earneſtly with God by prayers, that he would not ſuffer the trueth tryumphing over the tyranny of the enemyes, to be abolished by the diſcords and alterations of them that were of the houſholde? But what other meane could there be of appeaſing controver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſies, then to gather togither the parties diſagreeing one with an other, and when the matter was reaſoned of on each ſide friendly, by a good compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to drawe them to be of one minde? This was it then which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men deſyred that the preſent controverſies might be taken away, by a generall Councill aſſembled, and the future evils might be prevented. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> reporteth that <hi>Alexander Biſhop of Alexandria ſolicited Conſtantine and required of him earneſtly, that he would ſummon a generall Councill, and that not of himſelfe, but from the common adviſe of other Biſhops, whom he had conſulted with about this matter,</hi> booke 2. Tom. 2. hereſies 69. Ruffinus booke 1. chap. 1. From which wee may perceave what was the common deſire of all men. Onely <hi>Conſtantine</hi> next after <hi>God could give odours</hi> to this deſire, that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:6819:118"/> is, bring it to ſome deſyred iſſue: for, as ſaith Euſeb. <hi>It was in the power of the omnipotent God onely, to cure theſe evils.

                  <hi>¶ Vpon the Golden Altar:</hi> The <hi>Altar of incenſe, that was before the vayle,</hi> as Exod. chap. 30. ver. 3. Here it noteth the company of the choſen ſaincts, the firſt fruites of the whole world, as ſpeaketh Euſebius: in as much as this company doubtleſſe did holde the place next to the moſt holy, as in olde time, <hi>the Golden Altar was ſet before the vayle.</hi> And ſurely by right may this crowne of moſt holy men be called <hi>the Golden Altar,</hi> the great aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of which cometh nigheſt unto the maieſty of God, and in which the viſible glory of God moſt of all sheweth it ſelfe. <hi>Where,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>two or three ſhalbe gathered togither in my name, there am I in the middes of them,</hi> Mat. 18.19. Therefore it muſt needes be that this company should have the next place to the <hi>Moſt Holy,</hi> in the middes of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe did remaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Which is before the Throne:</hi> Within the circuite of the <hi>Elders.</hi> For that is ſaid both here, and in other places to be before <hi>the Throne.</hi> Which whole ſpace God would have to be proper to the elect on earth, who approach next to the Higheſt Throne, and are not ſeparated by the coming between of <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And the ſmoke of the odours went up:</hi> Thus farre the preparation of the <hi>Angell,</hi> now followeth his <hi>Miniſtery:</hi> and firſt that which perteineth to the <hi>Elect</hi> in this verſe, in reſpect of whom <hi>the ſmoke of the odours</hi> is ſaid <hi>to goe up,</hi> that is they were made partakers of the thing which they deſyred ſo greatly. The maner of ſpeaking is taken from the ſame cuſtome <hi>of the Levi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticall Prieſt, the ſimilitude of whom he hath uſed hitherto. Once every yeere the Cenſer was to be brought within the vayle, that the cloude of the incenſe might cover the Mercy Seate, which is upon the Teſtimony, to the ende that the Prieſt ſhould not die,</hi> as wee reade in the booke of Levit. chapter ſixeteenth, twelve and thirtheenth verſes. <hi>Alſo Incenſe was to be burned every morning when the lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes ſhould be kindled,</hi> as in the booke of Exodus, chapter thirty, verſes ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eight. Whoſe thicke vapour aſcending should pearſe through the vayle, and should perfume with a moſt ſweete ſavour all the inward moſt holy place: a viſible ſigne of our prayers, which doe penetrate the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and by the ſweete ſavour which they caſt forth <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> doe obtaine of God, that which wee aske. From whence the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Let my prayer be eſteemed as incenſe before thy face:</hi> Pſalme hundreth and fourthy one ſecond verſe. Therefore <hi>the ſmoke of the odours goeth up,</hi> when our prayers co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:6819:118"/> before God, doe obtaine for us that which wee asked according to his will. And when the holy men deſired that ſome way should be taken, for the ending of that ſtrife by a generall Councill proclaimed, by theſe things is shewed, that the thing was graunted them at length which they deſired. For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſeeing that he did try in vaine all other remedies, appointeth a generall Councill at <hi>Nice:</hi> he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the <hi>Biſhops</hi> to take publike horſes, and all to aſſemble at the day appointed. Whom at laſt being gathered togither, he moſt ſweetly admonisheth touching the care that they should have to ſearch out the trueth; he with very great equity heareth the diſputers againſt it: finally he governeth the whole buſineſſe with ſuch gravity and wiſdome, that at length the wicked blaſphemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned by common conſent, the holy trueth prevailed. By which fact of his ſurely <hi>the thicke cloude of the odours,</hi> went up from the hande of the <hi>Angell before God,</hi> when doubtleſſe by his care, paines, diligence, charges, moderation of the whole buſineſſe, ſo wholeſome a thing, ſo much deſired of all the godly, was undertaken, begun, and brought to an ende. Nowe he ſet a marke in the <hi>foreheads of the elect,</hi> wherby they might be diſcerned from the baſe ſorte of the ungodly. Therefore <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is that <hi>Angell, thoſe odours given him,</hi> which <hi>he ſhould give to the prayers of the Saincts,</hi> is the power to gather a generall Councill: the <hi>Golden Altar</hi> is <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe in the middes of this holy company: <hi>The thicke cloude of the odours going up,</hi> is the whole matter brought to an ende moſt proſperouſly. And this is that time untill which the foure <hi>Angels</hi> should keepe the truce, of which wee have ſeen at the 7. chap. ver. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ With the prayers of the Saincts: Prayers,</hi> peradventure by the want of a participle, not of the prepoſition <hi>with,</hi> as if the perfit ſentence were this, <hi>And the ſmoke of the odours, which were given to the prayers of the Saincts went up,</hi> the word being repeated from the former verſe, where was, <hi>that he ſhould give to the prayers:</hi> a thing very uſuall with the Hebrewes, to underſtand in the things that follow, the verbe that was uſed before. But by this reaſon the odours given should onely aſcende, and not alſo the other prayes of the ſaincts, which alſo are odours, as wee have ſeene in the fifte chapter &amp; at the eight verſe,</p>
               <p>Therefore by want of the prepoſition the ſenſe ſeemeth better to agree: Yet Theodorus bez have it with the prepoſition <hi>with,</hi> and not with the <hi>of</hi> as the Common tranſlation, and the Ieſuite, who interpreteth it material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the odours aſcending were made of the prayers of the Saincts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ſayd before, that he should give to the prayers of the ſaincts.

For the matter was not deferred for any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g while, but in the middes of the <hi>Nicene Fathers</hi> the firſt <hi>Angell</hi> blewe the trumpet: for the holy men had ſcarſe approved the trueth by a common conſent after they had conſidered the matter dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the haile began to fall downe violently, and to make a wonderfull great noiſe. Certaine <hi>Biſhops,</hi> verily <hi>citizens of the Earth,</hi> making a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded shew that they were offended with ſome wordes <hi>of the Confeſſion,</hi> but in very deede inflamed with the coales of the altar, laboured to hinder the conſent and to be againſt it ſo farre as in their power did lye. Theſe were five, <hi>Euſebius Nicomedieoſis, Theognis Nicenus, Maris Chalcedonenſis, Theonas Marmarienſis, &amp; Secundus Ptolemaitenſis,</hi> who malitiouſly alleadging a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt the word <hi>Conſubſtantiall,</hi> would neither agree with the reſt touching the faith, nor ſubſcribe to the condemnation of <hi>Arius.</hi> This was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt beginning <hi>of the haile,</hi> which a while after fell in greater abo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance. For after that <hi>Euſebius and Theognis</hi> faigning an alteration of their opinion, had recovered their former dignity, they went about this one thing, to try by all meanes howe that through the ſides of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> they might pearce the trueth. And theſe cunning deviſers looked ſo well to the matter, that noe times have bin more troubleous through moſt impudent falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, malitious ſurmiſes, lies, and uniuſt vexations: <hi>That Athanaſius had killed Arſenius, had raviſhed his hoſteſſe, had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away craftily the proviſion of corne at Conſtantinople, had miniſtred mony to one that attempted an alteration:</hi> &amp; what time affordeth exemples of like impudency? The good <hi>Arian Biſhops</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved from his ſeate <hi>Euſtathius Biſhop of Antioch,</hi> becauſe he was one of them that helde the trueth, a whore being brought forth, who obiected unto him dishoneſt converſation with her. Neither were theſe thinges done ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and privately, but that wee may acknowledge the huge noiſe <hi>of the haile,</hi> in aſſemblyes full of men, by continuall runnings up and downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But the broile ſtayed not here. <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Conſtanntie</hi> mingled haile with blood, baniſhed many, put many to death, Howe cruell a thing was it, that he compelled by torments to conſent to the wicked opinion, that reverend old man <hi>Holſius of Corduba,</hi> to whom his Father gave ſo great honour?</p>

And howe could it be, but all in whoſe hartes the trueth hath not taken deepe roote, either should be carryed into errour, or, which is worſe, should contemne all religion, should revolte from Chriſt himſelfe, should hate the worshippers of him, whom they should ſee to be bent to this onely thing, that they may rayſe up ſtrifes, contentions, and troubles?

But it shall be manifeſt from the whole Prophecy, that he ſpeaketh not of that which is to come, but of that which is paſt in reſpect of our age. Therefore they who call us backe to the naturall ſignification of the wordes, doe of ſet purpoſe deſire to hide the trueth ſo, that it may never shew it ſelfe. Let us come to the matter. Wee have heard that the ſtarres are the Miniſters of the word in the Churches, chap. 1.20. Although the word doth not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, but that alſo it may be applyed ſometime to others. <hi>Howe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, ſpeaking of the King of Babylon, <hi>art thou fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven o Lucifer, the Sonne of the morning?</hi> Iſaiah 14.12. Therefore the word fitteth them who gliſter aloft, as it were in heaven: eſpecially if they shine with the light of trueth. This is a <hi>great ſtarre,</hi> not darke and cloudy, but of a notable greatnes. <hi>It fell from heaven,</hi> by falling from the true Church, through Hereſy or ſome other ungodlines. <hi>Jt burneth as a torch,</hi> becauſe the fire of it should be flaming &amp; mounting up, coming forth openly abroad, not burning onely with a ſecrete heate, as even nowe the Mountaine did burne: whoſe flame yet should not continue longe, but the nourisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t failing as of a lampe, it should be cleane put out: <hi>It falleth into the rivers and fountaines,</hi> that is upon thoſe men from whom as from fountaines the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine should flowe unto others, of which ſorte are the <hi>Biſhops diſpoſers of the word:</hi> the divers conſideration of whom doth procure unto them divers names. Even nowe they were <hi>Shippes</hi> carrying hither and thither the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes of the word: nowe becauſe by their continuall flowing they doe maintaine that univerſall Sea of doctrine, and increaſe that which abideth in the multitude, worthyly are they compared unto rivers and fountaines. The <hi>ſtarre</hi> falleth into them, peradventure the common people remaining more ſyncere, which comprehendeth not ſo great ſubtilityes. Although howe shall the river flowe cleare, where the fountaine is corrupted? Vnles peradventure as the Sea waxeth not ſweete by the watering of the rivers, ſo neither doe the multitude gather bitternes from the corruption of theſe. But the matter is otherwiſe here, ſeeing a little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe: and albeit, the fountaines should be moſt corrupt, yet it should
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:6819:124"/> not be without daunger to them, who should drinke thereof, but they should perish even as well. <hi>The name of the ſtarre</hi> is <hi>wormood,</hi> not becauſe it should be called ſo commonly, but becauſe it should shewe her ſelfe to be ſome ſuch thing by the effect. And wormwood ſome time noteth the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes of afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>beholde I will feede my people with wormwood, Ier.</hi> 9. that is, moſt bitter corrections: ſome time the deadly poiſon of hereticall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as <hi>take heede that there be not in you a roote bringing forth hemlock or worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Deut. 29.18. that is, leaſt your minde be the ſeedeplot of any Idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try and wretched life, as the moſt learned Tremelius and Iunius doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde it. Both ſeemeth to be ioyned togither here, that the bitterneſſe of the calamity may be mixed with the vitious and corrupt doctrine. Now for the application. <hi>The third Angell did blowe</hi> about an eleven yeeres after the former. When <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> to whom befell the <hi>Eaſterne</hi> Empire, and by and by after the death of his Father, through the fraude of a certaine El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom he uſed familiarly, was caſt from heaven into the <hi>Arian Hereſy.</hi> The impiety began before through <hi>Arius,</hi> and gotte ſome patrons, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee have ſaid: but Arius forthwith counterfaited a recantation: by the ſame cunning <hi>Euſebius and Theognis</hi> recovered their chaires. Neither durſt any openly make any ſtirre, while <hi>Conſtantine</hi> remained alive. This fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour enraged the mindes of ſome, and drove them to worke the ortho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doxes what troubles they were able, but they made shewe of an other thing. Furthermore theſe were leſſer ſtarres: but <hi>Conſtantius</hi> was a <hi>great ſtarre flaming as a torch,</hi> bringing forth the thing out of lurking corners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cleare light: and endevouring with very great deſyre to amplify it. The ſame account is to be made of <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who followeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iulian</hi> &amp; <hi>Iovinian.</hi> By their meanes <hi>Wormewood fell into the third part of the rivers, and into the fountaines of waters.</hi> Before time the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſicke of this diſeaſe: but nowe they began to rage, having got ſuch rulers. <hi>The whole Eaſt, except Athanaſius and Paulinus drunke this deadly poiſon of the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Emmonians,</hi> ſee Hierome againſt the errours of Iohn Biſhop of Hier. Not onely <hi>Nilus</hi> was turned into bitternes, but alſo the <hi>rivers and fountaines of Thracia, Helleſpont, Bithinia, and the whole continent region:</hi> in all which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the <hi>Arians expelled out of the Churches all that were of a right iudgement, and puniſhed them ſhamefully,</hi> Sozom. booke 4. 27. More over <hi>the poiſon was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth on all men from the borders of Illyricum, even unto Thebais,</hi> as Baſyll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth in his Epiſt. 69. And what <hi>wormewood</hi> was at any time more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then for Chriſtians to be beaten with ſtripes to death by Chriſtians, to be deprived of their goods, and priviledge of the cities, to be burned in the fore head with a hotte iron, and to be handled with noe leſſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:6819:124"/> yea rather more cruelty of brethren, then before time of moſt fierce &amp; outragious enemies? Yet all theſe thinges and many mo ſuffered the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe at the handes of <hi>Macedonius of Conſtantinople,</hi> and others his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in office, not <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but <hi>fiendes of Hell,</hi> as Socrates writeth in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke, chapter 27. This miſchiefe vexed and over ruled a longe time that third part, both by it owne ſelfe, and alſo by the unhappy birth of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and other wretched ofſpring of that ſorte: nevertheleſſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Valens</hi> was dead, this flame alſo decayed, the matter of which was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as of a lampe, which hath noe more oyle. Thoſe <hi>Wormewood waters</hi> did wonderfully provoke the calamity of the haile with which nowe at lenght they mixe themſelves, and hindred that the burning flame of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Weſt</hi> could not be holpen. For nowe the three <hi>Trumpets</hi> came on with rage togither, which moleſted at the firſt aſunder and mor lightly.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Therefore the third part of the waters became:</hi> The <hi>Second effect</hi> shewing the fruict of the falling <hi>ſtarre.</hi> The Teachers and Bishops almoſt all, of that third part, who should be the ſprings of learning unto others, forthwith infected the wholeſome waters with the bitternes of that wicked opinion: but they made this deadly mixture not onely to themſelves, but alſo all which drunke hereof, and ſufferred themſelves to be infected with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me opinions, got to themſelves deſtruction, as hath ben declared by us before.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Afterward the fourth Angell blewe the trumpet:</hi> Here is mentioned one effect onely of the fourth <hi>trumpet:</hi> otherwiſe then in the former.

               <p n="13">13 <hi>And I ſawe and heard one Angell:</hi> Nowe he cometh to the three laſt <hi>trumpets,</hi> much more troublous then the former, as appeareth from the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon preparation in this verſe.

Whoſe nevertheleſſe ſingular good will, care, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, right iudgement in many thinges lifted him up on high farre abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the reſt of the common ſort, and that company of ſuperſtitious ones. <hi>He cryed with a lowde voice,</hi> denouncing to the world a great calamity by <hi>ANTICHRIST</hi> who should come ſtraight way. <hi>The King,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>of pride is at hande, and wich is unlawfull to be ſpoken, an army of Prieſts is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared:</hi> booke 4. Epiſt. 24. Againe, <hi>the King of pride is at the doores,</hi> in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me booke, Epiſt. 38. In the ſame place againe, <hi>where is that Antichriſt, which chalengeth the name of univerſall Biſhop, and for whom is prepared an army of Prieſts to attende upon him?

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Then the firſt Angell blewe the trumpet, and J ſawe a ſtarre:</hi> The firſt effect of the fift tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet is <hi>the fall of a ſtarr,</hi> as wee have ſayd in the Analyſis, which ſtarre is not any good Angell, they are never ſayd to <hi>fall from heaven to the earth,</hi> which alwayes in this booke is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the worſe patt: but to deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, as chap. 10.1. and 18.1. and 20.1. Furthermore, this ſtarre <hi>is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> of which in ver. 11. who is called <hi>Deſtroying,</hi> not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely becauſe he shall deſtroy others, but alſo becauſe <hi>he himſelfe ſhall goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction,</hi> chap. 17.8. Who <hi>hath come from the ſame bottomleſſe pit, from whence he hath cauſed deſtruction to others,</hi> in the ſame place: It is well true that a Holy Angell hath the key of the bottomeleſſe pit, chap. 20.1. but that is a key to <hi>ſhutte</hi> onely the bottomeleſſe pit, after that the Devill is put in: this on the other ſide is onely <hi>to open</hi> the ſame. Neither is that firme, <hi>that the key is never given to others, then our friends:</hi> for what other thing is the Key, then a power over a thing? Which wee knowe is granted to the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſpirits; whereupon the <hi>Devill</hi> is called <hi>the Prince of the world,</hi> Iohn 14.30. <hi>the Prince of the power of the ayre,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. <hi>the Prince of the darkenes of this world,</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. Therefore this ſtarre by an uſuall maner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Scriptures, is ſome wicked <hi>Man,</hi> to whom wee have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe, that the name of <hi>ſtarre</hi> is given. That Ambroſe, which not very long agoe Tonſtall published, will have him <hi>to be ſome Arch-heretique, who as a ſtarre in heaven, before he fell, ſhined brightly in the Church with learning and wiſdome:</hi> Ioachimus Abbas, <hi>that it is ſome Clergie man endued with knowledge of learning:</hi> Well and according to the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, as wee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:6819:128"/> ſhall ſee by and by. He is ſaid to have <hi>fallen</hi> in the time paſt, which fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe. For this ſtarre fell not firſt at this fift ſounding of the trumpet, but departed longe before from her ſoundneſſe by certen degrees, &amp; was tumbled downe into this pit of ungodlines. Although this preter tence noteth not onely the thing which is nowe paſt, but alſo after the maner of the Hebrewes, a continuing action. Of which ſorte are thoſe, <hi>This is my be loved Sonne in whom I have ben well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.17. So before, <hi>Beholde</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>I have ſtood at the doore and doe knocke,</hi> chap. 3.20. Of which ſorte are many in other places. <hi>It fell from heaven unto the earth,</hi> by revolting from the holy Church to a degenerating company of ungodly men. But this fall nowe firſt began to be marked, after the ſounding out of <hi>the fift tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pet.</hi> For that which is done leiſurely and privily, is not perceaved to be a doing, before that it be manifeſtly come to paſſe. <hi>The key of the bottomeleſſe pit given,</hi> is a power granted over infernall darkenes, which was ſhutte up in the bottome of the pit of hell, for that is the bottomeleſſe pit. Now firſt this power was granted to ſende forth the ſmoke, howſoever the <hi>fall from heaven</hi> was before that the trumpet ſounded. Nowe that wee may finde out who this <hi>ſtarre</hi> is, the thing is not to be meaſured by one or two circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances (for ſo wee ſhall finde very many to have fallen from heaven) but all things are to be taken togither: which ſurely whomſoever they ſhall fitte, he doubtleſſe is that very man whom this Prophecy painteth out unto us: it cannot be that the holy deſcriptions should be generall and common, ſo as they may be applyed to divers things contrary to the meaning of the Spirit. But it is to be obſerved, that this trumpet is not limited within any certaine boundes <hi>of the third part,</hi> as the former, but to have free liberty to ſpread farre abroad in what place ſoever it will, as in the common prohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the Angell cryed out in the ende of the former chapter, <hi>woe to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tans of the earth:</hi> as though the calamity should be contained within noe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther limits then of the whole earth: from whence it cometh to paſſe that <hi>the latter trumpets</hi> exccede the former, not onely in the very kinde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the evils, but alſo in the ſpace and largenes of the countries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to which they should bring dammage. Theſe thinges being thus layd, wee shall finde <hi>that this trumpet</hi> ſounded immediately within three yeeres after that Gregory died (whom eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowe wee shewed to be the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell flying from the middes of heaven</hi>) about the yeere from the birth of Chriſt, ſixe hundreth and ſeaven. At which time <hi>Boniface the third obtained of Phocas the parricide, that the Biſhop of Rome ſhould be univerſall:</hi> then alſo <hi>Mahumet in the Eaſt</hi> (whom Robertus Cetenenſis and Bibliander refer unto the ſame time in the eleven table: albeit I thinke that others more truly doe reffer

Therefore in your prayers ſeeke yee theſe helpes, finde yee out theſe defenders of your guiltines:</hi> in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>milies on the Goſp.

Moreover, <hi>from the croſſe, in which is the wood of the Lords croſſe, and the haires of John Baptiſt, wee have alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our Saviour, through the interceſſion of his fore runner,</hi> booke 7.

Neither was he the firſt authour of this <hi>Idolatry:</hi> neither did they which fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowed indevour to overthrowe it, but rather increaſed it with all their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And not without cauſe indeede, the fall of this ſtarre became the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt knowen, when the <hi>Biſhop</hi> began to be called <hi>univerſall,</hi> then yet the eares of all men might ring with the late crying out of Gregory, <hi>He is Antichriſt, who chalengeth to himſelfe the name of univerſall Biſhop.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which alſo it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, howe both they deceive and are deceived, who require inſtantly the teſtimonies of <hi>Ambroſe, Hierome, Chryſoſtome, Auguſtine,</hi> or of any other Father, by which expreſly it may be proved that the <hi>Pope of Rome is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> ſeeing his fall could not be ſo plainly diſcerned before the blowing of <hi>the fift trumpet:</hi> which doubtleſſe ſounded not, before theſe holy men cea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed to be among the living. <hi>The fall</hi> alſo of <hi>Mahomet from heaven</hi> is evident. The <hi>Saracenes</hi> had received the true faith of Chriſt by the inſtruction of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes</hi> a certaine Bishop of that people, when <hi>Mavia the Queene</hi> reigned, as in Socrates booke 4.36. or <hi>Mania,</hi> as Sozemene calleth her, booke 6. 38, At which time <hi>Valens</hi> governed the Empire of Rome in the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>From this beginning, or peradventure from <hi>Zacomus the Prince,</hi> who flourished a fewe yeeres before, the trueth ſeemesh to have ben ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong them unto the times of <hi>HERACLI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> corrupt without all doubt with much filth, and corruption, as is wont to come to paſſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, yet not quite abolished, as it is cleare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Mahumet</hi> himſelfe:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6819:129"/> who acknowledged the Scriptures, and tooke to himſelfe companions, or rather had for maiſters <hi>Sergius of Conſtantinople, a Neſtorian Monke, and Iohn of Antiochean Arian,</hi> Wherefore it is plaine that both of them had fallen. <hi>The key was given</hi> to the Biſhop of Rome in that manner which I have ſaid, For an ordinance of the Emperour being eſtablished, <hi>that the Biſhops of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me ſhould have full power to aſſemble generall Councills and to diſolve them, to confir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me and diſanull the thinges which ſhould be decreed in the Councills: and that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of Rome ſhould be the heade of all holeſome life, when before Conſtantinople was ſo eſteemed becauſe of the ſeate of the Emperour (as writeth Pomponius on Phocas)</hi> what could not this key open? Doth not the <hi>Pope</hi> worthyly boaſt of the <hi>Keyes,</hi> and carrieth them an enſigne for his armes, leaſt perhaps any should be ignorant, that he is the ſame, whom Iohn ſawe ſhould come? And this is that difference betweene the other ſuperſtitious men, and <hi>the Pope of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi> Many others did give more to the Saincts departed, then was meete, and defiled themſelves with the moſt grievous ſinne of Idolatry, yet to noe other was given the key to open the pit, but to this univerſall <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Let noe man therefore to hide the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> call forth the defenſe and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of others that erred, but let him ioyne togither all the properties, nor iudge of him for one alone. But as touching <hi>Mahomet,</hi> what could not he obtaine of the ſimple multitude, being counted of all a great <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? Whoſe ſowning from a diſeaſe the rude multitude beleeved to have bin a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Angell Gabriell.</hi> Surely a mighty Key and fit to open the pit of Hell. Therefore the reſpect to the time, the greatnes of the matter, thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greablenes of all things, which shall more appeare in the explication: fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the large boundes of this trumpet doe cauſe that as well <hi>Mahomet</hi> as the <hi>Romiſh Pope</hi> are to be contained under this ſtarre. Neither is it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete thing that many perſons ſhould be noted by one type: whom the likenes doth compoſe and make to be ſome one thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Therefore he opened the bottomeleſſe pit, and the ſmoke aſcended;</hi> Such was the <hi>firſt</hi> effect. <hi>The ſecond ſorte</hi> of effects doe ariſe one from another in a certen order. For firſt, <hi>he openeth the pit:</hi> from the pit opened <hi>ſmoke aſcendeth:</hi> out of the ſmoke, beſide the <hi>darkening of the Sunne, come Locuſts.</hi> And the <hi>Smoke</hi> is Hereſy in doctrine, and ſuperſtition in worship. For what other thing can breath out of the Helliſh pit? Before time indeede by many cranyes it ſent forth a foule vapour, but nowe through the doores opened by the helpe of theſe men, it began to goe out haſtily. The <hi>Sunne and ayre</hi> are dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, after that errours growed in uſe, and the light of the trueth was quite put out. Neither is it a darkenes of one place onely, ſuch as the high rope of ſome mountaine doth cauſe, but the whole ayre is filled with black<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6819:129"/> differring nothing from the darknes of the night. And certenly after once the <hi>Primacy</hi> was obtained of <hi>Phocas, Bonifacius</hi> the next both in name and order, conſecrated to all Saincts, <hi>Pantheon</hi> a Temple of Heathenish I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, practizing the ſame ungodlines, which the Ethniques did before, but under an other ſomething more glorious name. Whoſe holy day alſo he appointed, that the wickednes of worshipping an newe army of Gods, might not be Romes alone. <hi>Theodatus</hi> his next ſucceſſour decreed, <hi>that the parents who had received even through ignorance, their owne children from baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, ſhould not live togither any more in the ſociety of wedlocke: but that there ſhould be a ſeparation made, and the woman ſhould receive her dowrie, and be married to an other after a yeere.</hi> A newe kinde of inceſt by ſpirituall kindred, which God knewe not when he made his lawes of inceſt and unlawfull marriages, Lev. 18. Bonifacius the fift added, <hi>that wee by Chriſt are delivered from originall ſinne onely: that the lawe requireth noe more of us, then that which wee are able to perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me by our owne ſtrength, or at leaſt by the helpe of the divine grace.</hi> Vitalian, <hi>that all things ought to be done in the Church in the Latine tonge.</hi> Finally, that I may not recken up an infinite thing: the matter at length came to this point, that all muſt neceſſarily ſubmit their neckes to this yoke: <hi>That every ſoule that wilbe ſaved, muſt confeſſe the forme of the Romane tradition: and that all her decrees are to be received, as if they were ſtabliſhed by the divine voice of Peter himſelfe:</hi> as Agatho in his Epiſt. among the Acts of the ſixt Councill at Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This ſmoke which at the firſt opening of the pit, was but thinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every day thicker, almoſt by infinite degrees. And the maner of Wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shipping God, began to be noe leſſe corrupted, which did conſiſt wholy in <hi>Maſſes, Altars, Garments, Images, Chalices, Croſſes, Candleſticks, Cenſers, Banners, Holy Veſſels, Holy Water: in a multitude of Prayers, Pilgrimages, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and an exceeding great company of not onely idle, but alſo ungodly ceremonies,</hi> the moſt pure ordinance of God forſaken in the meane time, and troade under foote. Howe longe before, and howe farre this ſmoke ſpread it ſelfe in the Weſt, one alone <hi>Boniface Venofride an Ingliſhman</hi> may be inſtead of many witneſſes, who being the Legate and Apoſtle <hi>of Gregorie the ſecond, brought into bondage under the Pope the Franckes, the Noriques, the Boies, the Thy rigates, The Cattes, part of the Saxes, the Daces, the Sclavonians, the Friſes.</hi> How great a multitude of ſlaves by one mans travell? But this was nothing to the whole <hi>Weſt,</hi> covered in a shorte time after with the ſame ſmoke. For the <hi>Princes</hi> being made to beleeve, <hi>that, that Church was founded of Peter, and this Peter left the keyes and power given him of Chriſt to his ſucceſſours at Rome, and in no other place in the earth: ſo as he that ſhould cut of himſelfe from the Church of Rome, ſhould become a baniſhed man from the Chriſtian religion (as Adrian in his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:6819:130"/> Epiſtle to the Spaniards:)</hi> it is noe mervayle if by this darkenes <hi>the Sunne</hi> was taken away from all Churches every where. But this darke night became yet much more thicke, when at length the holy Scriptures being wholly layd aſide, and all good learning being banished, ſophiſticall Theologie was onely in account, the unpure Decrees and Decretals, held the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Then the Aegyptian darkenes was not thicker, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which came upon the whole Weſt. <hi>The Eaſterne ſmoke</hi> ſent forth by <hi>Mahomet</hi> was groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer at the very firſt beginning, <hi>ſo as it might be felt with the handes.</hi> He unto three holy Scriptures, as he ſpeaketh, that is, <hi>the Lawe of Moſes, the Pſalmes of David, and the Goſpell,</hi> ioyneth his <hi>Alfurta,</hi> an horrible Chaos of all blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemyes. And as if the Eaſterne people had not received hurt inough fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dotages of Mahomet, <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour ſpread alſo amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them the errour of the <hi>Monothelites.</hi> So then about theſe times, every man may ſee aboundance of ſmoke coming out of the opened pit. As touching the wordes, inſtead of <hi>a great fornace,</hi> Aretas, the Complutent edition and ſome others reade <hi>a burning fornace,</hi> peradventure both are to be ioyned togither, but the ſenſe is cleare.</p>

The reſt of the inſects ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve their ſtinges hidden within: the ſcorpion alone is armed with a longe ſtinge hanging out, which is not idle, but alwayes ſtriking, giving himſelfe noe reſte at any time, that he may not be wanting at any occaſion: his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is with a winding ſteppe, by which he ſtriketh the more unwarres. Such doubtleſſe is this <hi>ſmoky breed</hi> in the power of hurting, which at the firſt were <hi>Locuſts</hi> in multitude and ſloughtfulnes.

               <p>In which two verſes Pope Pius, who before his Popedome was <hi>Aeneas Silvius,</hi> was not afraide to pronounce, that the rage of the Devill is milder, then the monkiſh.

Although if they pleaſed not to drawe this wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon, at the leaſt way, they tormented with feare of Purgatory, and Hell, whither they thruſt downe all their enemies.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>And it was commanded them that they ſhould not hurt the graſſe of the earth:</hi> Theſe thinges shew over whom power is given them.

As touching the hay (fOr ſo may the Greeke worde with the olde Interpreter be well tranſlated, ſpecially ſeeing that the word <hi>green</hi> followeth next after) it is the dry graſſe cut of from the earth, which ſeeing it is the company of the wicked, as wee have often shewed, <hi>the graſſe cut of from thence,</hi> shalbe men ſeparated of God from the ſociety of other wicked, by certaine playne and knowne markes. <hi>The Locuſts ſhould not hurt theſe,</hi> not becauſe there lacked will and endevour; but becauſe they ſhould looſe all their labour in attempting their deſtruction, whom God would defende by his mighty arme againſt their violence. As wee reade that it came to paſſe in the <hi>Eaſt, when Conſtantine Pogonatus was Emperour,</hi> about the yeere
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:6819:131"/> 674. For then the <hi>Saracenes</hi> with great armies, by lande and ſea invaded <hi>Thracia,</hi> they aſſaulted <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the very ſeate of the Kinge: but after that by the ſpace of ſeven yeeres togither they could effect nothing by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſaults, at laſt many ſhippes being burnt by a fire newly found out of one <hi>Callimcus,</hi> and the reſt of the navie being partly drowned through a ſtorme, partly daſhed againſt the rockes, they were diſcouraged and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, ſo that having loſt all hope, they deſyred peace for thirty yeeres: which they redeemed by a yeerly tribute of a thouſand poundes of Golde, and 40 men priſoners. But doe you aske the cauſe why the <hi>Saracens</hi> fought here ſo unproſperouſly? There was a certen Hay time in thoſe countryes, when <hi>Conſtantine abandoned the impiety of Heraclius and Conſtans his Father, &amp;</hi> rooted out utterly <hi>Monotheliſme,</hi> the ſixt Councill of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſſembled.

But God ſufferred them not to hurt his haie, which he himſelfe doubtleſſe had moved in ſtirring up <hi>Leo</hi> to prohibite that wicked <hi>Idolatry:</hi> which haie time became yet more evident, when <hi>Gregorie the ſecond</hi> excommunicated the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and deprived him of <hi>the Empire</hi> and of his <hi>felowſhippe,</hi> that is cut him of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked earth, becauſe he had ordayned that holie images and pillars ſhould be throwne downe and deſtroyed. Therefore the <hi>Locuſts</hi> are driven away by battaile, by famine, by a ſea-fire, by tempeſt, and haile mingled with fire, that they might acknowledge God to be the defender of his haie: and the whole na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vie of ſhippes, tenne onely excepted, did perish: of which tenne, five alſo were intercepted of the Emperours ſouldiers, the reſt at length arriving at <hi>Syria,</hi> that they might be tidings bringers of that horrible ſlaughter. It was Doubtleſſe a manifeſt example of the haie ſaved from the iniurie of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts.</hi> Beſides theſe Locuſts, the whole <hi>Eaſt</hi> was alſo full of Monkes: but as the ſcorpions in ſome landes doe not hurt, as in the <hi>Jlande Pharo, in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike Alpes, and elſwhere:</hi> ſo in very many places they bring death without any remedy; and as the Locuſts deſtroy very often whole nations with famine, ſome time alſo they are for meate: ſo the poiſon of the <hi>Monkes</hi> was more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6819:132"/> sharpe in the <hi>Weſt part,</hi> in that it did not enter into the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> neither were they much hurtfull in <hi>the Weſt,</hi> to the cut graſſe. Diſcreete men, to whom the trueth did shew it ſelfe more clearly, deſpiſed the hypocrites without feare, and ſufferred not themſelves to be devoured of them, as the other unskilfull multitude, which through a shewe of Godlines became a pray.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Neither all greene thing, neither all trees, but onely thoſe men, which have not, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning is, that ſome greene thing, and ſome trees should be delivered from this vexation of the Locuſts, all the reſt being yeelded up to their cruelty, who had not the ſeale of God in their foreheades. In the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer chapter and ſeventh verſe, <hi>the third part of trees was burnt, and all greene graſſe,</hi> to wit, <hi>of that third part,</hi> becauſe all that part of graſſe, and of trees, should be of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of the caſt awayes. But unleſſe ſome trees should be counted in the number of the elect, the foure <hi>Angels</hi> should not have bin forbidden before to ſtay their rage, even for one moment of time, ch. 7.1. Here therefore a fewe are taken out of a great number, as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force of the wordes doth shewe ſufficiently. The wordes doe beare doubtleſſe that interpretation, which the moſt learned Theod.

And this placeth <hi>every greene thing, and every tree</hi> in the number of the ſealed: that attributeth the ſame thing <hi>to ſome certen trees, and onely to ſome greene thing,</hi> counting the reſt of the grone in noe place of thoſe that are to be ſaved, more agreably to that which wee mentioned before. chap. 8.7. Neither is it needfull in the other places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to departe from the naturall property of theſe particles, if wee shall conſider the matter diligently. From theſe thinges then it is prooved that there are ſome within the compaſſe of the falſe Church, whom God chalengeth to him ſelfe by a privie ſealing: and that this <hi>greene thinge</hi> and <hi>trees</hi> are <hi>men,</hi> as wee have interpreted, chap. 7.1. the exception requiring it, which noteth expreſſly men ſealed, that alſo <hi>the greene thinge and trees ſhould be men,</hi> out of the number of which men are excepted. And ſurely there
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:6819:132"/> were many men, yea ſome Kingdomes <hi>England, Denmarke, Germanie &amp;c.</hi> whether <hi>the rage of the Sarracenes</hi> came not: and in thoſe places where they raged, did they exerciſe tyranny over any other, then thoſe men, who had not the marke of ſalvation? What other ſtrife doe the Hiſtory-writers of thoſe times and places report, then about the ſepulchre and the croſſe of the Lord, and ſuch vaine things wherewith Chriſtians were bewitched? Neither did <hi>ſuperſtitious Locuſts</hi> vexe any other men but thoſe which were addicted to their ſuperſtition, as even nowe wee ſaid.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And to them was commanded, that they ſhould not kill them:</hi> Howe great is their power, wee may perceive from the <hi>degree</hi> of torment, from <hi>the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it,</hi> &amp; <hi>eſtimation</hi> of death, as a lighter thing. As touching the firſt, <hi>it was not permitted them to kill, but to tormente.</hi> Howe may this agree to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racenes,</hi> who shed ſo much Chriſtian blood? Theſe thinges ſeeme to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, not ſimply, but in compariſon. Yf conſideration be had of that ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, which in the next trumpet was to come, the <hi>Saracenes</hi> may well be thought, not to kill. At their firſt beginning the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> name was not ſo much hated: neither was there neede of any great murder, when the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they ſet upon gave out their vanquished handes, yeelding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their owne accord to have fellowshipe in that ungodlines. In the latter times there was a more fierce and bloody victory, by howe much the battell was more eger. But the Spirit did purpoſely choſe out that kinde of ſpeaking, which might agree very well to both the troupes of <hi>Locuſts.</hi> For thoſe in the Weſt should not be ſo fierce and cruell in killing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. But this comparative ſpeach noteth both the ceſsing of theſe in this reſpect, neither taketh from the other all killing, though farre leſſe then that which was to come.</p>

For howe may ſo ſmall a ſpace agree to the Kingdomes either of the Sarracenes, or of the Papiſts? Let every day be counted for ſo many yeeres, that five monethes ſhould be at leaſt as much as an hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty yeeres, after the manner of the Scriptures in other places, as in Ezechiel <hi>fourty dayes, every day for a yeere I give thee:</hi> and according to the continuall cuſtome of this booke (as hereafter wee will shewe God willing) yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe what is this ſo ſmall and short a diſtance of time, to theſe ſo longe continuing tyrannies? Wherfore Bullinger and ſome others of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen doe thinke that this number is aſsigned as it were of the hotter monethes, in which eſpecially the <hi>Locuſts</hi> are wonte to be in chiefe ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, for all the graunted ſpace of tyrannizing, how great ſoever it shall be. The which opinion ſeemeth to mee like to be true, unleſſe that the very great care of the accounte, which is uſed in other places, required here alſo ſome certen and limited thing. The Ieſuites, being like unto the <hi>Cuttell,</hi> doe pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſely as I thinke, powre out here their darkenes, to the ende that all thinges being confounded and diſordered they may lurke the more ſafely: they will have ſo many common monethes to be ſignified, as though that <hi>woe</hi> had ben in vaine, which the <hi>Angell flying through the middes of Heaven</hi> had ſung before the three laſt trumpets. Did he not foreshewe by the ſame that the plagues to come, should be more grievous then thoſe which were paſt? What greater thing shall this trumpet have then the former, if the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lieth the whole force of it, neither are endued with power to kill, and alſo that the power which they have is of ſo short time? It was a great deſtruction which the former <hi>trumpets</hi> brought in, and full of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, neither paſsing over in a moment, yea not in a fewe yeeres, as wee have shewed: but if this calamity be ſo shortened, neither shall it compare with the former evils in grievouſnes of torment, and alſo in reſpect of the shortneſſe of the paine, it would be found much eaſier. But I will not ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d long in refuting the toies of the Ieſuites. It is moſt iuſt that they who will coyne figures at their pleaſure where they are not, should not ſee the ſame, where they are in very deede, having as it were their eyes blinded. The thing peradventure may be ſomewhat more apparant, if wee obſerve cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine poſitions: the firſt of which is this, <hi>whole Kingdomes and their Kinges are not ſpoken of here, but onelie the Locuſts and their exceeding great power:</hi> which wee ſee to riſe up by certen degrees. Firſt, they come forth out of the <hi>ſmoke:</hi> the ſmoke <hi>out of the pit opened:</hi> the pit is not opened before <hi>the key be given:</hi> neither is the key given, aſſoone as <hi>the ſtarre fell,</hi> but ſome long time after.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:6819:133"/> From which it is neceſſary that the Angell be farre more auncient then the infernall generation. For who requireth the iſſue of ones body to be equall to the parent? Wherefore that is not to be caſt upon the <hi>Kingdome</hi> it ſelfe <hi>and Kings,</hi> which is proper to the <hi>Locuſts.</hi> Whoſe age is not to be regarded from hence, but onely the ſommer time &amp; vigour of this overflowing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of vile perſons: The ſommer time, I ſay, becauſe neither the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> nor the laſt ende ſeemeth to be limited in this ſpace. For they muſt needes have a beginning to growe, before they have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to hurte. But after their power should be diminished, they should hurt noe ſmall time through the ſtinke of their rotten carkeiſes. The ſeconde, <hi>the time is not to be counted from the bringers of the paine; but from the ſufferers.</hi> Whereunto have refference that verbe paſsive, <hi>that they ſhould be vexed,</hi> of which we ſpake even nowe. For it importeth much from whether of them wee make the accounte: if the reckening be from the <hi>Locuſtes</hi> themſelves, they should have power to vexe in noe place of the world, but for the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of theſe <hi>five monethes</hi> onely: but if reſpect be had to the <hi>ſufferers,</hi> the ſame diſtance of time shalbe given to certaine countries, and shalbe eſteemed according to the diverſity of places, howſoever the continuing of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, in ſome place it may be ſhalbe longer. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which followeth a third poſition, <hi>that the five monethes are not once onely to be numbred, but ſo many to be underſtood figuratively, as there are countries, which were to undergoe the ſame calamity for ſo greate a ſpace of yeeres.</hi> Which foundations being laid, we ſhall ſee noe ſmall conſent of the Hiſtory. The firſt troupe of <hi>Locuſtes</hi> was of the <hi>Saracenes,</hi> who beginning about the yeere 630. to fly about, Mahomet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their captaine, <hi>in the firſt five monethes,</hi> that is, the firſt hundred &amp; fifty yeeres afflicted moſt miſerably the whole <hi>Arabia, Syria, Meſopotamia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>menia, Perſia,</hi> they tooke likewiſe <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſpoiled <hi>Afrique,</hi> and at length en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Spaine.</hi> True, wilt thou ſay, but they have helde all theſe places, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept peradventure <hi>Perſia, Armenia,</hi> and ſome parte of <hi>Arabia,</hi> not onely for an hundred and fifty, but more or leſſe foure hundred yeeres. I deny not, but in the meane time it is to be conſidered howe long they were trou belſome to men of the <hi>Chriſtian name</hi> in thoſe places. It is certaine that there were congregations of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in great number, when firſt the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cenes</hi> invaded: and that they were not utterly rooted out by and by, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long continuing miſery, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth they were wholy deſtroyed by death, by ſlaughter, by falling away to that impiety waxing ſtrong, which became every day more confirmed by an acceſſe of newe ſtrength. By which things it came to paſſe, that the countries which before time perteined to the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhippers of Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>the ſpace of thoſe five monethes,</hi> became all to the infidels,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:6819:134"/> either noe Chriſtians at all, or very fewe being left there. In the next ages wee shall finde the Hiſtory very ſilent as touching the making mention of <hi>Churches</hi> in thoſe places. But wee doe limit this firſt invaſion within the ſpace of an hundred and fifty yeeres: not becauſe at the ende of this time, they were diſpoiled ſtraiteway of the countries which they ſubdued, but be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe afterward they fought with ill ſucceſſe againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> often ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vanquished, killed, put to flight, hardly keeping that which had ben gotten, much leſſe getting any more. At the yeere 780. about the ende of <hi>Leo Copronimus,</hi> that is after the hundreth and fifty yeere, ſince which time they firſt grewe ſtronge, their inſolency was reſtrayned by almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all received ſlaughters, &amp; by domeſticall diſcordes: <hi>Leo hanodraco</hi> brought them under in <hi>Aſia: Conſtantine</hi> who raigned with <hi>Irene his mother</hi> put them to flight. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> was beaten by <hi>Leo Armenius.</hi> The ſame did <hi>Theophilus, Michael the ſonne by Baſilius, Petronas and Andreas Captaines:</hi> and the other following <hi>Emperours</hi> founde noe leſſe good ſuceſſe againſt them: ſo that nowe there being a manifeſt decay of their former proſperity, not without cauſe their florishing ſommer may be thought to have ended in <hi>the Eaſt,</hi> they began to braunch out in the Mediterrane Ilands, in <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> all which places by the ſpace of an other hundred and fifty yeeres they cruelly ſpoyled and deſtroied. The inhabitans of <hi>Cyprus</hi> being thruſt out of their dwelling places, and tranſported other where about the yeere 807. at length by the proſperous conduct of <hi>Zimiſca,</hi> recouvered their native countrie after an hundred and three ſcore yeeres. This ſpace is greater by a fewe yeeres: but ſome weakening and infirmity is wonte to goe before the laſt deſtruction, ſo as the <hi>vigour</hi> may agree very well unto the number ſet downe. They bring in ſubiection to them all <hi>Sicilia</hi> aſſailed often befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re about the yeere 867: neither could they be expelled wholly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, before that <hi>Georgiꝰ Mamaces</hi> deſtroyed them utterly about the yeere 1060 more or leſſe. <hi>Zonaras</hi> reporteth that not longe after they returned under the power of the <hi>Agarenes,</hi> but <hi>Ambuſtus Catacalon,</hi> many thouſandes of them being killed, repreſſed them ſo, that they neither durſt nor could bring much hurt to the Chriſtian inhabitans. This ſpace alſo is longer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the determined monethes, unleſſe peradventure the dwelling of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes</hi> was not ſo trobleſome to the inhabitans, in thoſe yeeres numbred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and beſide. But in <hi>Italy</hi> the thinge is more cleare. About the yeere 830 the <hi>Saracenes</hi> being called out of Babylon for aide, shee felt deſtruction by and by from them, whom shee ſent for to be her helpers: for they brought a very grievous deſolation upon the chiefe part of that country: neither was there any pauſe of the vexation, <hi>Otto ſecond</hi> being <hi>Emperour,</hi> in the yeere
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:6819:134"/> 980, that is by a plaine accounte, in the hundreth and fifty yeere after the ſpoiling begun, killed them with ſo great a ſlaughter, that from thence he got a name, and was commonly called <hi>the Death of the Saracenes.</hi> Here is ſo great a conſent of the time, as if the <hi>Spirit</hi> had reſpected this country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and in it had ordained an example of his wrath, in delivering her up for to be ſpoiled of theſe Locuſts, which was the teacher of impiety to the whole earth, and out of which an other kinde of Locuſts did ſpring noe leſſe noiſome then that former. But touching them wee shall ſee by &amp; by: let us proſecute thoſe thinges which remayne concerning the former. Therefore this firſt company, which by a limited ſpace of an hundred and fifty yeeres did robbe and ſlay in ſundry places by a certen interchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courſe, at length newe troupes of Turkes followed. Who at firſt were trobleſome not ſo much by the dammage which they brought by themſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ves, as that in taking by force the countries of the <hi>Saracenes,</hi> who abode in heapes togither in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they drove them forth more into all the <hi>Weſt.</hi> But after the poiſon of the <hi>Agarenes</hi> waxed olde, leaſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> name should enioy even a very little peace, the Turkes tooke upon them their of<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice, which they performed more cruelly, then they themſelves whom they ſucceeded. For beginning at <hi>Romanus Diogenes</hi> in the yeere 1073, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken of the Turkes, and againe ſent away, having his eyes firſt put out, was killed of his owne people. The Turkes not enduring that their good turne should thus be nothing regarded of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> vexed and tooke away the whole Eaſt: untill a newe invaſion of the <hi>Scythians</hi> made them fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, and conſtrained them to deviſe howe they might defende themſelves, rather then to moleſt others: wherby they were brought to ſeeke peace of <hi>Iohannes Duca Emperour of Rome,</hi> who then lived at Nice, Byzantium being lately taken of the <hi>Latines.</hi> Which fell upon the yeere 1223. ſee Niceph. Gregoras in the ſecond booke of the Romane Hiſtory. For ſo it pleaſed God the ſupreme governour, that the <hi>Turkes,</hi> as <hi>Locuſts</hi> &amp; <hi>Scorpions</hi> should vexe, before that after the manner of cruel Lions, they should make hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſlaughters without any difference of ſexe or of perſons. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthily their aſſayling untill the yeere 1300, was called robbing by the Hiſtory-writers, rather then warre: undertaken rather with a minde to take booties, then with anie hope to poſſeſſe the places, which they had taken.</p>
               <p>This rehearſall hath ben ſome thing full of wordes: but my deſire is to bring light unto the Hiſtory: which that I may doe, I regarde nothing my owne trouble.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:6819:135"/>
               <p>The other kinde of <hi>Locuſtes</hi> are our Religious ones in the <hi>Weſt</hi> part of the world, who as longe as the <hi>Saracens</hi> were in their chiefe ſtrength, had not yet attained their perfection. They overflowed indeede before through great abondance, but the ſommer was not yet very hotte, wherein they ſhould moſt of all tyrannize, untill in the times of <hi>Innocent the third</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, Franciſcans, the Poore, The Penitent, the Obſervants, the Trinitaires, the brethren of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and other infinite of ſcowring of that kinde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe with full power to vexe men at their pleaſure. There was noe age ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with <hi>religious,</hi> as Polydore Virgil and other learned men have obſerved. Neither did ſome writers thinke, that all the orders were even to be reckoned up, both becauſe they would have regard to brevity, and alſo becauſe they were wonte often to ſpring up after the manner of tod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtooles, as ſaith Polydore Virgill in booke 7.3. And certenly nowe was the Power of darkneſſe, <hi>the Locuſts</hi> being armed with their ſtinges. <hi>Hildegardis the Abbeſſe</hi> ſawe from God and bewayled a fewe yeeres before, the miſery to come by the begging Fryars and hungry <hi>Locuſts,</hi> and not longe after experience taught the world, that her ſorrowe was not in vaine. This pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue dared longue, neither left it any thing uneate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up wholly, untill about the yeere 1360, to wit, and hundred and fifty yeeres after their power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, at length a <hi>Weſt winde</hi> began to blowe by <hi>Wickleffe</hi> and other godly men: which ſhaking them of from the boughes, ceaſed not to blowe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were driven in to the <hi>Skarlated Fathers,</hi> as it were <hi>into the read Sea.</hi> But that none may obiect that their ſtinking carkeiſes doe even hitherto infect the aire: noe man can deny but that ſince that time they have loſt their ſtinges, which thinge onely this Prophecy reſpecteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And their paine ſhould be as the paine of a Scorpion:</hi> Not that they ſhould kill as Scorpions (for this was forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them before), but that they ſhould inflict a wound cauſing noe leſſe ſharpe griefe, then the ſtinging of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. It is likely that ſome great inflammation of blood, ſtriking &amp; pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing througly doth thereof ariſe: eſpecially ſeeing it is a chollerick creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as wee have declared before, ver. 3. But what torment is to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that, whereby men are ſpoyled of their goods, are pulled aſunder from their wives, are berefte of their children, the chiefe comforts of this life: neither this by any neceſsity of death, the griefe whereof is forgotten with the time, but wherby the living &amp; ſtrong are ſeparated away from the living, that the griefe may be renewed dayly, and a man onely left alive for miſery? That men ſufferred all theſe thinges at the handes of the <hi>Sarracens,</hi> is more knowne, then that it needeth examples: and wee ſhall ſee that they endured noe leſſe the ſame at the handes <hi>of the begging fryers,</hi> if wee shall well
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:6819:135"/> marke ſomewhat more diligently. For theſe heires ſpoiled of their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, in ſitting by their parents ready to dy, and wringing from them, partly by threates of Purgatory, partly by an hope to be delivered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce through their ſinging of maſſes for their ſoules, and by their prayers, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions of great revenew, farmes in the country, lands, Lordshippes, and great ſummes of money. For which thing any word of the ſick man halfe dead was ſufficient, or if the breath were gone, yet any ſigh uttered at their demaundes. It was a grievous thinge to the heires for to be diſpoiled of their goods by this fraude: but it was more grievous to be bereaft of their wives and children. What was it elſe but under colour of a vowe to breake marriages, to withdrawe children from the governement of their parents, that againſt their willes, they would keepe themſelves cloſe in their Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries? And here are to be referred thoſe moſt famous decrees: <hi>If any ſhall ſay, that a ratifyed marriage, is not broken of by a ſolemne profeſſion of religion of one of the two yokefellowes, let him be accurſed.</hi> This decree is of the <hi>Councill of Trent:</hi> but it was in uſe in former times, chiefly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe <hi>Monkes</hi> abounded. And many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples doe proove that not onely marriages ratifyed were undone, when as it is wonte to be a hotter fire, and greater torment not to obtaine the thing deſired, but alſo thoſe that were accomplished, which examples being ſufficiently knowne, I doe paſſe over purpoſely. More over <hi>that it is lawfull for children to enter into a religion againſt the will of their parents.</hi> An other torment of miſerable men. They tooke then away husbandes, and wives, and children from thoſe, to whom <hi>God and Nature</hi> had conioyned them. Whom when they had in their keeping as pledges, what could they nowe be afraid of their moſt loving mates, and moſt tender parents, who durſt not to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to doe any thing againſt it, leaſt they should be cruell towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds their owne bowels? yea rather what should they not hope for and carie away? This tyrannie therefore brought noe leſſe wealth and ſecurity to the ſpoilers, then vexation to the ſpoyled. That I may not ſay, howe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it did moleſt the Prieſts and Biſhops that the ſickle should be thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their harveſt of the <hi>ſuperſtitious Locuſts,</hi> and that they are wiped both of all eſtimation and alſo money with the people, while the <hi>Fryars</hi> bare the ſway in hearing confeſsions, and doing other things, which by right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined to the ſecular Prieſts, as the <hi>Archbiſhop of Biturim complaineth in an aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſembly of the French Biſhops,</hi> Maidenburg Centur. 13. chap. 9. colum. 964. But peradventure this was a more eaſy torment, conſiſting wholly in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this life: that was farre greater, which did caſt a ſnare upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <hi>by enioyning a neceſſity of confeſſing all their ſinnes with every circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. Jnnocent the third,</hi> to whom the <hi>Weſterne Locuſts</hi> owe their ſtinges; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:6819:136"/> the firſt poiſon and ſtrength of vexing into this ſuperſtition. <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>confeſſeth not alone all his ſinnes faithfully at leaſt once a yeere to his owne Prieſt, let him both living be kept from entring into the Church, and alſo dying let him want Chriſtian buriall,</hi> in the Councill of Lateran, canon 21. The Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts armed with this ſtinge, afflicted men with moſt grievous torments. And certenly what racke could be more painfull? Not to confeſſe was to betray their ſalvation, as they were made to beleeve. But to confeſſe was all one plainly, with this, for a man to offer his throate to the tormenter: when as thoſe holy hypocrites would abſolve moſt readily <hi>the wolves</hi> &amp; <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> from great ſinnes: and would devoure the poore <hi>Aſſes</hi> for one bundle of litter ſtollen away, as a certen man wrote pretily in <hi>the Penitentiarie of the Aſſe: The iniury which thou haſt done to a ſtranger in taking away the litter from him, is an exceeding great wickedneſſe.</hi> Such then is the torment, ſo farre as may ſuffice to manifeſt the trueth: the full declaration whereof would be longer then would fitte our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Therefore in thoſe dayes:</hi> Men shall be ſo weary of their life, that they shall ſeeke death, even as a thing which they deſire very earneſtly, that is, Death shalbe eſteemed a leſſe evill, then this torment. Hence it came that the <hi>Mardaitae</hi> did fortify <hi>Libanus,</hi> flying from the <hi>Saracenes:</hi> to whom aſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled many captives, ſervants, and that were home-bred, becauſe they were not able to endure any longer the tyranny of the <hi>Saracenes.</hi> Although the ſafety which they ſought by falling and flying away, did runne from them; who were compelled againe by force and armes to their former bondage, as ſaith Zonar, in Conſtant. Pogonatus. Our <hi>England</hi> was ſo grievouſly ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>xed and polled <hi>by theſe Weſterne Locuſts,</hi> that it complayned in vaine, that shee was more miſerable then <hi>Balaams Aſſe:</hi> clubbes &amp; ſpurres did pricke their ſides, and ſuffered them not to reſt even a very little while: but to go forward, and to obey their moſt uniuſt exactions, which <hi>the Holy Pope</hi> did urge continually by theſe <hi>Horſleaches,</hi> was nothing elſe, then to goe willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly into certen deſtruction, ſet before their eyes. Certenly <hi>during the reigne of Henry the third,</hi> men by the iuſt iudgement of God being given up to the luſt of theſe <hi>Locuſtes,</hi> were ſicke of a diſeaſe more grievous then death. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did this miſery belong to one Kingdome alone, but alſo the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>Scotland, France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Germany</hi> groned under the ſame burden. From whence not without cauſe <hi>Iohannes Camotenſis,</hi> as he is alleadged of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pa in the booke of the vanity of ſciences,</hi> ſaid, <hi>the Legates of the Popes of Rome did ſo play the Devill in the Provinces, as if Sathan had gone forth from the face of the Lord to ſcourge the Church.</hi> But chiefly men ſought death, and founde it not being terrifyed of theſe locuſts with the feare of Purgatory. They would
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6819:136"/> willingly have died the common death of the body, which all antiquity iudged alwayes to be the Haven and ende of all miſeries; but when the Lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſts thundred out that the flames of Purgatory were not inferiour to hell fire in torment, they quaked for feare being about to die, and felt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to be ſpoiled of all confort of death. From hence it was that for to be freed from this their feare, they did give to the Locuſts, whatſoever they would aske, yea often times when they did aske nothing at all. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe howe of neceſsity did the miſerable ſoule ſtagger and was vexed, when even common ſenſe did teach, that ſinnes cannot be purged by any corruptible price? Thought therefore &amp; anguish of minde did preſſe them downe on every ſide, conſidering that a bought confidence did free them from paine little or nothing at all.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>And the forme of the Locuſts:</hi> A deſcription of the Locuſts, which firſt in cruelty are like unto <hi>horſes prepared unto battell.</hi> There is a great alacrity of this beaſt unto fight: <hi>he diggeth his feete in the valley, and reioyceth in his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth going forth to meete the weapons, he moketh at feare, and is not made afraid, &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not backe through feare of the ſword:</hi> Iob. 39, 25.

               <p>Famous are the invaſions of the <hi>Sarracenes</hi> in all the Hiſtories: the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like proueſſe of the <hi>Popes bande</hi> hath not peradventure ben ſo obſerved of all: which yet is as cleare and famous, if wee conſider the thing neerly. What ſouldiers uſed <hi>Innocent the third</hi> to roote out the <hi>Albingenſes?</hi> Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>Dominicus</hi> the mourninge trumpetour and Heralde of this warre, who a little after, was made one of the foure Princes <hi>of the Begging Fryards,</hi> he muſtered an army of <hi>the Croſſe-bearers:</hi> by whoſe aide, as it were of horſes running to the battell, he hoped to repreſſe the hereſy, as they call it, &amp; to abolish it utterly. This order had indeede their originall before nowe, but shortly after being brought almoſt to utter decay, <hi>Innocent</hi> reſtored it for this warre: that the miſchievous perſons, as it were halfe dead, might be brought againe from Hell, by the authority of the ſame man, by whoſe meanes they should have power to tyrannize and to vexe the world a freſh more ſpitefully, ſee Polydore Virgill, of Invent. in the third chapter of the 7. booke.</p>
               <p>Neither did the <hi>POPE,</hi> whoſe manner was to confounde all thinges, and to ſet <hi>KINGES</hi> togither by the eares (as <hi>PROB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LLEN<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>SIS</hi> sheweth in an aſſembly at Wirizburg, under Honorius the fourth) afterward uſe any other incenſours to raiſe up hatred.</p>

In howe great ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>count it hath bene ſome time, Bellarmine sheweth out of Hierome in an Epiſtle to Auguſtine, which is the 26 among the Epiſtles of Auguſtine. <hi>I pray thy crowne,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou wouldeſt salute in my name, thy brethren, my Lord Alipius, and my Lord Evodius.</hi> And Auguſtine in an Epiſtle to Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian a Bishop, Epiſt. 147. <hi>Yours doe adiure us by our crowne: ours doe adiure you by your crowne.</hi> Mee thinke I heare, <hi>yea by this Scepter:</hi> Homer.

See howe fitly he interpreteth Herodotus, minding noe ſuch thing, but onely moved with the conveniency of the thing it ſelfe. For that which he ſaith, <hi>they are ſhorne belowe rounde,</hi> he hath tranſlated elegantly, <hi>The haire belowe cut of in the likenes of a little circle,</hi> a thing longe a goe forbidden to the Iewes: <hi>you ſhall not cut rounde the crowne,</hi> becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the <hi>Arabians</hi> neighbours as it ſeemeth, who were shorne after that manner: that in noe thing they should be like the <hi>Jdolaters,</hi> Levit. 19.27.

It is knowne that the Arabians were called <hi>Agarenes</hi> of Agar, Sarahs maide, and this name is often in Zonaras, Nicetas, Gregoras, and other Grecians, who were neceſſarily to report the thinges that were done of them, this name being given them for a reproch, as writeth Sabellicus, Ennead. 8. booke 6. leafe 177. b. but moſt auncient, and in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt glorious, 1 Chron. 5.10.19. &amp; 27.31. &amp; long before the booke of Chronicles was written, Pſal. 83.7. from whence alſo it is evident, that the name is honourable, and by which they would have themſelves to be

From whence often times in other places he ſaith, that this is a wronge name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that it was chalenged of them ſelves wrongfully &amp; uniuſtly.

Then the Virgin falling downe at his knees ſaid, moſt deare Sonne have thou compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and moderate thy iuſtice with mercie.

To be shaven and to glory in the name of a woman, are not contraries: which to be ſignifyed by theſe allegories, and not any proper covering of haire, I ſuppoſe to be manifeſt enough.

And ſo many they ſeeme to have ben at the firſt: but afterward to have ben brought to foure. <hi>Laonicus Chalcocondy las</hi> ſaith, that in the beginning there were <hi>ſeven,</hi> booke 1 of the Turkes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires But he ioyneth a certaine man called <hi>Teciem</hi> with <hi>Ottoman,</hi> and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth the children aſunder from the fathers. But it is not a thing to be mervayled at, that this confuſion of barbarous people could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented certenly by the Hiſtory-writers, albeit Gregoras lived in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me time, and had the charge of keeping the rolles of the Emperour Andro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nicus the elder. This nation came ſome ages before from Armenia &amp; the countries bordering on Euphrates. From which places they did repell ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily the Romanes, which were wearied longe agoe, and waſted with many calamityes. But about the beginning of the reigne of Andronicus Paleolo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gus the elder, before the yeere 1300. it ſpred her ſelfe abroad through A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, even unto the Sea Aegeum. But that they should not breake forth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other place, then from their fore appointed liſts, to wit from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates, at that time, when the raines were let looſe unto them, God by the helpe of the <hi>Catelani</hi> drove them againe unto Euphrates. Theſe men their Captayne being Ronzerius, were ſouldiours in pay under Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, the proweſſe of whom was ſuch, that for feare of them, the Turkes fledde not onely from Philadelphia, which then they beſieged, but alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt beyonde the auncient boundes of the Romane Kingdome, as Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras

This feare therefore did drive them into the countries about the river Euphrates, &amp; did as it were lay fetters upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a time. Neither was it a ſmall bounde tying them, that they could not rage as they would, in that their forces being devided unto many Princes, every one a part were too weake, that they should dare to attempt any great thing. Both theſe impediments were taken away at the time of the power granted them. For firſt of all the <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly about the ſame time, to wit, about the yeere 1291, whatſoever by lawfull warre the Chriſtian Princes tooke in Paleſtina, and in the countries adioyning in twelve expeditions, and after the poſſeſsion of 196 yeeres, they had loſt nowe all that, ſo as thoſe landes being given over, every one went their way home. Finally all the families of <hi>the Turkes,</hi> whether of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or compelled by force, ſubmitted themſelves to that one family of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> By which meanes the <hi>Turkes</hi> being free from all feare of the enemy behind them about <hi>Euphrates,</hi> neither having any before them, that could ſet againſt them ſufficient forces, renewed their aſſault againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whom in short time they overwhelmed wholly, as it were with a deluge.</p>

               <p>And thoſe twelve thouſand <hi>Ianizarites</hi> whom they have to their ordinary gard for the ſafegarde of their body, are all gunners.

Is not the gunpouder made of ſalt peter, coale, and Brimſtone? The <hi>Spirit</hi> therefore deſcribeth this enemie to us by thoſe weapons, which should take their beginning almoſt togither with his tyranny. But this fire cometh out of their mouth, becauſe they doe ſende forth this fire as eaſily, as a breath: Yf onely that chiefe robber shall commande deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be brought upon any countrey, moſt quicke handes are readie, which forthwith doe his commande, and bring all thinges into a wilderneſſe.</p>

But whereas he ſaith, <hi>of theſe three,</hi> it is to be underſtood of theſe three togither. For ſmoke and brimſtone aſunder have no harme in them. He reckeneth three, as diſtinct, becauſe the former deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fire required ſuch a reckening. Although men shall not be conſumed by gunnes alone, but one kinde of warlike inſtruments is put for the whole.</p>

For who would not al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moſt faint through wearineſſe of ſo long continuing trouble, hearing noe other thing in the <hi>Church</hi> for a long rowe of yeeres then <hi>violent ſtormes of haile, burning mountaines, falling ſtarres, the Sunne darkened, troupes of Locuſts, &amp; ſerpents with a head at both endes, caſting out flames of fire,</hi> wherby an infinite number of men should burne miſerably? Nowe therefore to them, that have ben as it were a long time and much toſſed on the maine ſea, is the land pointed at, and the haven shewed, in which at length there might be reſt from theſe troubles: neither this onely, but alſo in the meane time a proſperous winde is breathed forth, which may cauſe a readier ſayling. For which purpoſe a moſt mighty <hi>Angell</hi> came downe from heaven, divers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe, who blewe the <hi>trumpets,</hi> or of whom mention was made long agoe elſewhere. For they were <hi>ſervants,</hi> this is the very <hi>Lord Chriſt:</hi> as whoſe <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, countenance, voice, &amp; whole decking,</hi> is more imperiall, then can befall to any creature. Neither doth ſo ſtrange a forme, and unlike to the true na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture of man, hinder: conſidering that it hath ben manifeſt from the firſt chapter, that he taketh upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that outward shew eſpecially, which may ſerve moſt to the declaring, and confirming of the things propounded. Therefore as touching the deſcription of him, he is called <hi>ſtrong,</hi> becauſe he hath ſtrength ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to deliver <hi>the Church</hi> from thoſe adverſities, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with it shalbe oppreſſed. <hi>He cometh downe from Heaven,</hi> becauſe nowe at length after a long diſtance of time, he would viſit his <hi>Church,</hi> from which he ſeemed to have ben abſent now a long time. And about the blowing of the <hi>ſixt Trumpet,</hi> when the <hi>foure Angels</hi> were looſed, in the yeere 1300, as was ſayd before, <hi>Chriſt</hi> began to give a more plentifull leave to enioy his preſence, then in the times going next before. Yet howſoever he came downe from heaven, he was <hi>clothed with a cloude:</hi> not knowne indeede plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to the world, but covered yet with ſo great darkeneſſe, that he was to be ſeene, as it were through a lattice. <hi>He carrieth the rainebowe on his head,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table meſſenger of the olde covenant, and of faire weather, both that wee may underſtand him to be faithfull and conſtant in his promiſes, and alſo that the former ſtormes shalbe driven away dayly more and more, by little and little, untill at length a cleare sky shall returne on every ſide. <hi>His face ſhineth like the Sunne,</hi> Chriſt indeede being moſt glorious, at leaſt in that parte, in which he is knowne and perceived of men: <hi>but his feete doe yet bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne with fire,</hi> becauſe his loweſt members on the earth muſt burne yet with a

Although there should be noe danger of peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in this fire, <hi>for the feete are pillars, yea and that alſo of Braſſe,</hi> chap. 1, 15. For theſe thinges belong to the ſame time, ſee chap. 2.18. So therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> carrieth in his owne perſon, an image of the preſent <hi>Church under the ſixt Trumpet.</hi> Which began to encreaſe againe about the yeere 1300, yet covered with much darkeneſſe, which notwithſtanding gave hope of a more perfit reſtoring in due time: &amp; in the meane while revealed the moſt ſweete face <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> which the world had not ſeene a long time: although the faithfull in the meane ſeaſon were troden downe with manie calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>And he had in his hande a little booke open:</hi> To whom fitteth better an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen booke, then to him who hath opened the ſeales of it? chap, 5.5. Becau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> commeth forth with an open booke, it is taught that nowe againe after longe ignorance, leave shalbe given to men to knowe the trueth, as wee knowe it came to paſſe about that time. For at once the <hi>Turkes</hi> began to wax ſtrong in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and moſt learned men to ariſe in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> who maintained the trueth boldly. But it is onely a little booke, which he hath in his hande, to wit a ſmall booke, either becauſe the ende nowe approching, there should not remaine ſo many alterations, but that they might be contained in a little booke, as after in the ſixt verſe, <hi>delay ſhalbe no more:</hi> or rather becauſe the knowledg of men in this time should be ſlender and ſmall, whereunto perteineth <hi>the clothing with a clowde,</hi> as wee have shewed at the former verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And he put his right foote upon the Sea;</hi> This groſſe Sea of the inferiour world, is the doctrine of the corrupt <hi>Church,</hi> as chap. 8.8.

The <hi>Earth,</hi> conteineth the reſt of the common people, who in name are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But the feete are the members <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> to wit, his faithfull ſervants, by whom as it were by feete, he walketh on earth. Of theſe the right foote is the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by which being ſet upon <hi>the Sea,</hi> it is declared, that Chriſt nowe at length will chuſe out ſome from that vile ſorte of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall men,</hi> for to be his feete and faithfull members. Alſo the left foote placed on <hi>the earth,</hi> sheweth that he will take out likewiſe ſome from the lay people, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could not compare with the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> thoſe right feete, in excellency of giftes, yet they should be made his true members, &amp; enioy the ſame honour with them. Such right feete were <hi>Iohannes de Poliaco, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus Patavinus, Iohannes de Ganduno, Michael Cicerius, Michael de Coriaria, Guilielmus Ockam, Gerardus Ridder, Iohannes Rochetalada, Armachanus an J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Biſhop, Ioannes Wtcklefus</hi> and others. Chriſt drew them out of the ſalt ſea
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:6819:148"/> of the <hi>Popiſh doctrine:</hi> whom hee tooke out from the company of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall men, and brought them to ſweeter and wholſomer waters of the trueth. Out of the lay people, he had for his left feet, <hi>Ludovicus Bavarus the Emperaur, Marſilius Patavinus, Dantem Aligherium,</hi> and many others who defended to their power the trueth ſeene and acknowledged.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And he cryed with a loude voice as as Lion roareth:</hi> Hitherto hath ben the deſcription <hi>of the Angel,</hi> nowe the chiefe cauſe of the things that were to be ſealed up is ſet forth, to wit, the <hi>crying out of an Angell</hi> like a bellowing <hi>Lion,</hi> for ſo the Greeke word ſignifyeth properly that which belongeth to Oxen and the like beaſts. Lions are properly ſaid <hi>to roare:</hi> albeit ſome times it is attributed to Aſſes and Camels, as Heſichius sheweth: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>ring like unto Aſſes, Camels, and oxen.</hi> But the <hi>Angell</hi> belloweth, bccauſe he muſt ſpeake ſoftly, and dared not to lift up his voice (for there is ioined togither with it, <hi>he cryed with a loude voice,</hi>) but that he might shewe that the meekenes and patience of the oxen is nowe to be mixed with the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Lion. And ſo indeede Chriſt, as it were revived againe then in his members, cryed out ſtrongly: which crying out nevertheleſſe carried a shewe of the bellowing oxen onely, neither yet made any man greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid. Thoſe firſt ſpringing up <hi>Chriſtian Worthies</hi> ſtrove by lamentings and complaining ſpeaches: yet nevertheleſſe they bare a grievous yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dage, which they could not shake of, whatſoever ſtrugling they made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ The ſeven thunders uttered their voice:</hi> Which as an Echo anſwered this lowing. And theſe ſeven thunders are I ſuppoſe <hi>thoſe Angels</hi> of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in chap. 14.6. &amp;c. Surely the time agreeth fitly, as wee will ſhew at the place: then alſo their office may worthily be likened to thunder, which ſounded againe when this roaring was uttered. For taking their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from thence, they made a noiſe with ſo great roaring, that ſuch as deſpiſed the lowing of the <hi>Angell,</hi> should at length begin to tremble for feare of this thunder. But it is an excellent thing, that the thunders ſpeake not, but at the crying out of the <hi>Angell,</hi> even as alſo the Echo hath noe voice of it ſelfe, but onely yeeldeth againe the voice which it hath received; ſo thoſe <hi>reſtorers of the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th,</hi> howſoever the world condemned them of no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velties, brought notwithſtanding nothing, but that which themſelves had learned of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And when the ſeven thunders, &amp;c.</hi> Such were <hi>the cauſes,</hi> now is shewed the <hi>care of Iohn:</hi> whom when the ſeven thunders were heard, being about to w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, a voice from heaven prohibiteth, &amp; biddeth <hi>to ſeale them up.</hi> Theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries were to be kept ſecret, as before, <hi>the booke could not be read, as long as
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:6819:148"/> it was ſealed,</hi> chap. 5. For theſe times knewe not what thoſe thunders did ſpeake, neither did they marke whereunto at length they would come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And write them not:</hi> So Aretas, the Common tranſlation, and other Greeke Copies, as though theſe wordes should declare, what that <hi>Seale,</hi> should be, to wit, not to put in writing, but to have it ſecret for himſelfe alone. But is any thing revealed privately <hi>to Iohn,</hi> which he might not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh abroade? It is not ſurely to be thought, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> to this ende <hi>received this Prophecy, that he might ſhewe it to his ſervants,</hi> as before in chap. 1.1. Where, <hi>to his ſervants,</hi> ſaith he, not <hi>to any one alone,</hi> but for the common good of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> Wherefore theſe wordes ſeeme thus to be underſtood, as though he should ſay, bring not theſe voices of the thunders into this place, but reſerve them to an other more proper and fit. Which iudgement certaine printed copies doe favour, which read, <hi>&amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after thou writeſt,</hi> or peradventure, <hi>ſhall write:</hi> but although <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> the firſt vowell being altered, and the laſt ſyllable take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away: yet I ſcarſe thinke, that readings quite oppoſite one to another are founde at any time. Wherefore when it is heard to iug what ſenſe to take, that interpretation pleaſeth me moſt of all, which alike agreeth to both, to wit, according to that meaning which wee brought even nowe. Vnleſſe ſome would rather have that theſe wordes <hi>and ſhalt write hereafter</hi> be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the next viſions which follow: but that the voices of the thunders should be buried in ſilence for ever. But the former interpretation is more ſure, that the <hi>Revelation</hi> was given for a common ſolace, and that therefore thoſe things should be diſcloſed afterward in their place, which nowe are commanded to be kept cloſe. Albeit I deny not that ſome thing may be communicated to the <hi>Saincts</hi> apart, as to Paul, who heard <hi>thinges that could not be uttered,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.4. But the drift of the Prophecy is to be regarded. More over to what purpoſe should it be that thoſe things should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with an eternall ſilence, if at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that were to be brought to paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe, which the thunders ſpake? Therefore let them be ſealed for this time, in which they were hidden from the world, as it commeth to paſſe for the moſt parte in their firſt beginnings: afterward let them be written, in the place wherin they shall obtaine their ende, when the things shall become moſt plaine by the event. That is to ſay, being perfected they should be un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtood, but they should not be knowne as long as thy were to be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And the Angell which I ſawe ſtanding &amp;c. lifted up his hand:</hi> Hitherto of the thing that was to be <hi>ſealed:</hi> now it followeth touching the <hi>finiſhing of the myſterie,</hi> which firſt is of things <hi>to be communicated.</hi> It is confirmed by an othe, <hi>that it ſhalbe ſhortly.</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:6819:150"/> wherby it cometh to paſſe, that the things which the Prophets foreshewe to come, the common ſort ſo interpret as if they were paſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his moſt famous ſonge about the ende, ſingeth this <hi>Myſterie,</hi> Deut. 32. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> every wherein the Pſalmes: So Iſaiah, Ieremiah, Ezechiell and the reſt: it would be too long, even to recken the places.

If theſe things are to be underſtood of the laſt comming of Chriſt to iudgement, there are not very many words, or at the leaſt cleare enough in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets touching this thing. But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence wee learne that the old prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are not to be finished, either in the firſt comming <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> or in the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but that they reach even unto the perfit accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Miſtery.

Which was a notable benefit of God: this office had ben banished a long time from the earth: put to flight by the hellish ſmoke, which the <hi>bottomeleſſe pit, opened by the Romish Starre, ſent forth:</hi> nowe it came againe by the grace of God, and men were bidden to take the little booke open, which the former times had shutte: the force of which commandement raiſed up thoſe, which I ſpake of, and many others which followed: whom unleſſe an heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly deſire had inflamed, they would not have offerred their

               </p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Therefore I went unto the Angell, ſaying to him, give mee the little booke:</hi> This gifte is to be obtained <hi>by intreatie,</hi> even alſo of them, who have abilitie give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them thereunto. Wee muſt deſire earneſtly of God with Iohn, that he will <hi>give us the little booke,</hi> albeit wee be nowe entred into this office. And the <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke is given,</hi> when greater abondance of knowledge is miniſtred, which was moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this age, now firſt of all the art of printing bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out by a great gift of God.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And it shall make thy belly bitter:</hi> The word taſted in the mouth is ſweet, but bitter in the bellie, that is, <hi>the knowledge of Gods will is verie ſweete &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant of it ſelfe: but the publishing of it, wherby fruite may come to the reſt of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, even like the digeſtion of meate, when it is concocted in the ſtomake, is full of troubles and anguish.</hi> Which thing ſometime Ieremy tryed and complained of, chap. 15.16.

The condition of that time could not be shewed more briefly and manifeſtly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I therefore tooke the little booke:</hi> Althoug Iohn heareth, howe great trouble this meate will bring him, yet obeyeth he willingly the <hi>Angell,</hi> and eateth up the booke as he was commanded. There was a better love in him to Gods word, then any regard of lothſomneſſe, or wringing in the belly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bitterneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:6819:151"/>
               <p>Such excellent fortitude was in thoſe learned men of that age before ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: it could not be, but that they knewe certenly, howe great trouble they should procure to themſelves by avouching the trueth: yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they laboured valiantly, ſetting more by the ſweetneſſe which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ioy of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by all the bitternes of perill. By whoſe example all <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the word muſt goe on boldly: neither is the office to be forſaken becauſe of the troubles. It is noe newe thing for that to be found bitter by experience, which being taſted a little at the tongues ende ſeemeth ſweete. Therefore let every true <hi>Prophet</hi> have this leſſon well medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tated: leaſt peradventure lighting upon unexpected evils, he be overcome at length through infirmity.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Thou muſt Prophecy againe:</hi> Nowe in fewe wordes he sheweth, to what ende the former ſigne was uſed, that it may be underſtood that <hi>Prophecie</hi> was to be reſtored againe to the <hi>Church</hi> in thoſe times.

For the whole ſixt trumpet is troubleous to the wicked, in which reſpect it is called the <hi>ſecond woe,</hi> chap. 9.12. &amp; 11.15. But if the times be diſpoſed in this manner, it hath little miſery for them, who by the ſpace of two and fourty moneths triumphed in all mirth, when in the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne while the Godly are afflicted. What ſo great hurt should the ſixt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet bring them, if after that short trouble of one yeere, moneth, day, and houre, they should have a threefolde longer felicity and more? It is moſt certen therefore that this Prophecy reacheth backe even to the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of the trumpets: but that it is ſet in this place, becauſe the whole ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of this time could not be perceived before that it should be brought to an ende. And nowe indeede God raiſed up learned men, <hi>Philippus Bergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſis, Franciſcus Guicciardinus, Martin Luther, John Carion, Philip Melanctho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Gaſpar Peucer, Henry Bullinger, Iohn Sleidan, John Functius</hi> &amp; others, who lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king togither the hiſtories of things that were done, repreſented this face of the Church in their writings. Which Prophecy doubtleſſe was to be ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth neceſſarily. For not without cauſe ſome might aske, what was done with the true <hi>Church,</hi> when <hi>the Haile, ſmoke, the third part of the graſſe, the burning Mountaine turned the Sea into blood, the Locuſts, and the other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endes tyrannized?</hi> In all theſe Trumpets hath ben a wonderfull ſilence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it.</p>
               <p>Nowe therefore the Spirit sheweth by this Prophecy revived, of what ſorte the condition of that time was in the meane while, leaſt that alone should be paſſed over, for whoſe ſake this writing was undertaken. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this chapter is to be ioyned with the ſeaventh, where the Prophecy touching the Saincts ceaſed.</p>
               <p>To the ſame perteineth <hi>that ſealing,</hi> and this, that I may ſo ſay, <hi>Temple meaſuring:</hi> and it is the ſame wholly and all one thinge, except that that belongeth to every <hi>ſeverall cityzen,</hi> this, <hi>to all</hi> iointly, and to ſome chiefe members.</p>

               <p>Nowe as touching the wordes: <hi>the reede given</hi> is the power graunted of the trueth, wherby the Saincts should meaſure the length and breadth of the true and lawfull worship, leaſt in a wonderfull confuſion of things, they should ſwerve from a due proportion. In ſo much as it is like a <hi>rod,</hi> it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that the trueth shalbe much holpen, and borne up by the authority of head rulers. For <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore Theod. Beza hath well reſtored this place from the Complutent Edition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Mete the Temple:</hi> The true Chriſtian Church is ſhadowed by the type of the olde temple: every ſeverall part of which was deſcribed once moſt exactly and meaſured by the commaundement of God himſelfe: to the ende that men should knowe that this houſe is framed of God, that it is not of humane building: and therefore they should not take ought upon them in changing things at their pleaſure, as though the celeſtiall wiſedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me had not ſufficiently provided for the moſt convenient maner of every thing. The things to be meaſured are <hi>the Temple, the Altar, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the worship.</hi> The Temple was devided <hi>into the moſt holy, and the holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> which had the <hi>altar</hi> of the burnt offring ſet at the doore. He biddeth him to mete theſe onely, of the whole building: ſmall partes of the whole, and onely the more ſecret roomes. For the tabernacle before time being <hi>thirtie cubits long, and twelve broad,</hi> was ſixteen times and more leſſer then the <hi>court.</hi> Afterward the temple enlarged by Salomon, and by the Angell in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiell, had farre more ſpatious courts. The temple then alone being mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſured, sheweth that the true Church shalbe brought into very narrowe ſtraights, limited with ſmall boundes, and remooved wholly from the ſight of men. For the holy place was not opened to the people, but the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:6819:153"/> Prieſts alone miniſtred in that place, of which ſorte here all true Chriſtians are counted, as before chap. 1.6. Therefore when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> came to the Kingdome, the Church began to hide it ſelfe in a ſecret place, by going fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſight of the world into a certen more inward roome. Whereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth that <hi>ſealing,</hi> chap. 7. Wherby a fewe of many were ſevered by ſome privie marke. Neither ought it to ſeeme mervailous that this ſeparating of themſelves from others, was made in ſo great glory of peace, and deſire to advance the <hi>Chriſtian name.</hi> For when ſome raiſed up contentions, others coveted much to get honours, many travailed with hereſies and brought them forth, all did bend themſelves with all their power to heape up ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitions: was it eaſy in that ſtate of things for any pure, ſyncere, and ſound thing to abide in his place? But the obſcurity of the Saincts indeede, grew more every day, by how much more thoſe foure miſchiefes increaſed. The which thing Rome alſo her ſelfe granted unwares. For doeſt thou dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de where our Church was before Luther? Therefore thou knoweſt not. But underſtand thus, where thou Rome wert not, to wit, in the hidden holy place of our God: whither shee had runne for ſuccour with all the reſt of the Saincts from thyne infection. But when thou boaſteſt, <hi>that thou art a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſet on a hill, which never was hidden,</hi> but hath flourished with a continuall and manifeſt ſucceſsion, confeſſe alſo that thou art not the true Church, and that thou haſt founde noe place in that covert of protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And them that worſhippe in it:</hi> Mete is a common verbe, and of a conti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuall quantity: but here figuratively it ſignifyeth alſo, <hi>number thou,</hi> as if he should ſay, put into the number of nine thoſe fewe, who in trueth worſhip me ſecretly: for there was a certen number in ſealing the elect, chap. 7. which ſame thing is declared here in other wordes, when he biddeth him <hi>to meete the worſhippers.</hi> All the Saincts are ſayd <hi>to worſhip on the Altar,</hi> becauſe they put all their hope and truſt in the death of Chriſt: which kinde of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, perteineth not to the <hi>Tribe of Levi</hi> alone to offer, but to <hi>everie true godly man</hi> likewiſe. And this onely is that thing which diſcerneth the true Chriſtian from the falſe and counterfait. But that the moſt in thoſe times, <hi>worſhipped not ſo on the altar,</hi> wee muſt thinke not without cauſe, when it is to be ſeene clearly from their writings, that many who ought to have ſhined before others in all knowledg, attributed to much to their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry workes, and to their owne holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>But the court that is without the Temple:</hi> So Aretas and the Complutent edition doe reade: but ſome bookes have, <hi>which is within the Temple,</hi> to wit the court of the Prieſts, in which was the altar of burnt offrings, which he mentioned even nowe, which court ſome time is called by the name <hi>of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:6819:154"/> temple.</hi> Neither is this reading to be reiected raſhly. For Iohn is not bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>to mete this court,</hi> but onely <hi>the Altar</hi> of this court. And it may be that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth more fitly with that, which followeth, if the <hi>inward court</hi> be caſt out, then if that be caſt out, which was already without before. But both have reſpect to the ſame ende, that it is nothing to be eſteemed whatſoever is more then thoſe foreſayd <hi>Temple, Altar</hi> &amp; <hi>Worſhippers. For the court is given to the Gentils,</hi> that is, to the Chriſtians as for a name: neither this onely, but alſo <hi>the holy City</hi> (which they should tread under foote, not by ſpoiling it like an enemie, but in frequenting it daily under a colour of worshipping, as in Iſaiah 1.12.) and that for <hi>the ſpace of fourtie two moneths.</hi> Theſe things shewe clearly, what should be the condition of the falſe Church in thoſe times, wherein the <hi>trueth</hi> should be hidden. Firſt it should noe leſſe exceed in number and multitude, then the people which once dwelt at Ieruſalem, and was wont when the holy things were done to be in the utmoſt court, exceeded the number of them, who executed their office in the Temple. Good God, howe great difference was there? Exceeding great was the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the inhabitans, and of them that continually flocked to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: howe in the meane time few Prieſts were there within, in compariſon of that great multitude which was exerciſed without? There should be the ſame quantitie of fained Chriſtians, in reſpect of the true and naturall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Secondly it should have her counterfait worshippers, dwelling ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere the Temple. For they should poſſeſſe Ieruſalem, and the whole court should be theirs. How neerly was the court ioyned to the Temple? How did it compaſſe the ſame round about? Ezech 40.5. Good God how nigh was this ſociety? Who durſt have condemned the court of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neneſſe, unleſſe the Angell himſelfe had commanded it? And the event ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely was altogither anſwerable. For in thoſe firſt times, when the foure firſt trumpets ſounded, what was Athanatius alone unto ſo greate aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes of Bishops? What afterward was Baſil the Greate, or Gregorie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene unto almoſt the whole Eaſt? Yf thou shouldeſt reſpect the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> who would not have contemned one or two in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of ſo great a rable? But if you would reſpect <hi>holines,</hi> were they not all Bishops? Did not all deſire to be eſteemed valiant defenders of the trueth? How eaſy was it therefore here, either by <hi>the number</hi> or <hi>likenes</hi> to be deceaved? In the laſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes alſo there is the ſame boaſting of <hi>the holy citie, and of the outmoſt court</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Temple. Is not the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> ſpread through the whole earth? Have the Lutherans hereſies, as they clatter, ever paſſed over the Sea? Have they ſeene at any time eyther Aſia, or Afrique, or Egypt or Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia? Who can doubt of the Holy Catholike Church, which counteth her
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:6819:154"/> Bishops even from Peter himſelfe, by a moſt certen ſucceſsion? But <hi>Rome</hi> nowe boaſteth of her multitude: by how much in time paſt shee hath flou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rished in greater number, by ſo much the more is shee nigher to the great aſſembly treading under foote Hieruſalem, and further of from this ſmall number lying hid in the Temple: wee ſee in this place the whoriſh Church moſt furnished both with multitude and neighbourhood. Yf theſe things shalbe ſufficient to get the victory, thou haſt overcome, o Rome, ſo well in populous City, as in proximity. But let them looke to it, that are car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let them in the name of God weigh the matter in earneſt, and diligently: and not ſuffer themſelves to be beguiled with vaine boaſting. Let them minde, that unto them that looke but of a farre off, they ſeeme all to be in the Temple it ſelfe, who are but within, yea the outmoſt part of the walles: but let them come nigher, and they shall ſee moſt cleerly, that thoſe whom even now they thought to be in the moſt inward roomes, are kept certenly from the holy place with braſen walles. Albeit the diſcerning now is not ſo heard, as it was in time paſt, while the Church had no place in the publike. Read but the writings of our men, &amp; by the grace of God thine eyes shall waxe cleere to perceive the trueth. Mayeſt thou not worthily ſuſpect the Popes craft, reſtraining thee from buying and ſelling of our bookes, and of all familiarity? Yet nevertheleſſe doe thou ſtrive ſo much the more to knowe the trueth, that thou ſhalt ſee the ſame to be hated of thine, through the conſcience of their owne defor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mity.</p>

                  <hi>¶ Two and fourty moneths:</hi> The time wherein the true Spouſe should lie hid, and the falſe should rule. But how great darkeneſſe is here? And noe marveile, in ſo great blindneſſe of mans underſtanding. Wherefore be thou preſent, who haſt received theſe thinges that thou mighteſt diſcloſe them to thy ſervants, to the ende that by thy guiding I may goe ſafely. For to diſpell the obſcurity, it is to be obſerved firſt, that there is not ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe <hi>two and fourty moneths</hi> three common yeeres &amp; an half going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. I hope that the accord of the things hath proved already, that the <hi>foure Euphratean Angels</hi> in the 9. chapter, are the <hi>Turkes.</hi> To whom power being given for one houre, and moneth, and yeere: ſeeing that the three hundreth yeere is nowe ſlipt away, is there any ſo obſtinate, who will yet avouch that <hi>theſe two and fourty Moneths</hi> are to be reſtrained togither wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin the narrowe limites and ſtraights of their owne and naturall-ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation?</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:6819:155"/>
               <p>Hereunto is to be added, that ſeeing theſe moneths pertaine to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> chap. 13.5. that the ſame was not yet borne in the time of the revelation. For Iohn ſawe her riſing up afterward, chap. 13.1. which thing no where is either ſaid, or can be ſaid of the Romane Empire, this is certenly that ſpace, in which Antichriſt shalbe borne, shall growe, be wounded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover health againe: wherein he shall exerciſe power over eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But can all theſe thinges be performed in three common yeeres and an halfe? Peradventure <hi>Therapontigonus Plat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But Antichriſt should for iuſt cauſe ride on the very Sunne, to ſubdue all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries none excepted in three yeeres and an halfe, and in the meane while to give up himſelfe through idlenes to all delights &amp; wretched intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. But it is more plaine yet after in the chap. 20.4. Where the enemies of the Beaſt refuſing to be ſubiect to his governement, and raigning with Chriſt a thouſand yeeres on earth, to with all that ſpace of time in which the Divell is bound and tyed in chaines, and the ſubiects of Antichriſt lie dead before the firſt reſurrection, doe proove neceſſarily that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Antichriſt was through all that time: otherwiſe how were they able to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſt him, not onely commanding nothing, but alſo not living? The ſame thing alſo ſhalbe minifeſt from the perſon of Antichriſt, which in his place wee will shewe not to belong to one man alone, but to a certen kingdome and ſucceſsion, chap. 17. Secondly ſeeing this account is not common, it is needfull that wee recken theſe moneths after the manner of the other ſcriptures: for almoſt all things in the Revelation are expreſſed after the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of the auncient types. But what is that maner? Shall every ſeverall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth note ſeaven yeeres, as the weekes in Daniell? It is wholly without all example and reaſon, to compare the moneths to the weekes. Neither will the wordes ſuffer it by any meanes. For the Angell sheweth that every eche day is to be counted, from whence he noteth commonly this ſpace, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by two and fourtie moneths, ſome time by a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, as in the next verſe, and in chap 12.6. But that way whereby the moneths are brought unto the weekes, and there is made the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:6819:155"/> number of two hundred ninetie &amp; foure yeeres, numbreth not the fourth part of the daies. Wee therefore thinke that every one is to be reckened, and that ſo many yeeres are to be aſsigned, as there are dayes in theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, which agreeth wholly unto the manner of the weekes in Daniell. Thirdly that theſe are not Iulian yeeres. For theſe two and fourty moneths make onely a thouſand two hundred threeſcore dayes. But ſo many Iulian moneths doe effect a thouſand two hundred ſeventie eight dayes, &amp; more. Whereupon there wante of the Iulian, foure ſcore dayes, and ſome what more: how many yeeres the thouſand two hundred and three ſcore dayes doe lacke (every one by it ſelfe being taken for one yeere) of the thouſand two hundred three ſcore Iulian yeeres. What moneths then doeth the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gell uſe here? Not the Lunarie, nor Iulian, but onely the Aegyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moneths, every of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He hath ſhewed, that according to the cuſtome of this nation onely, wee muſt recken the moneths, becauſe it was it that should kill the Prophets of the Lord, and in the ſtreete of whoſe great city they should lie troden under foote, &amp; unburied for a mocking ſtock, after in ver 8. After the manner of theſe moneths wee have limitted by thirty daies, every of thoſe <hi>five moneths,</hi> chap. 9. Fourthly, that this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is not to be begun, either from the paſsion of the Lord, or any other time, which went before this writing. For as wee have told you divers ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes theſe wordes, <hi>I will ſhewe thee the things that muſt be done hereafter</hi> in chap 4.1. will not beare it. Neither by and by after the giving of the Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For next after followeth <hi>the dwelling in heaven, the cloathing with the Sunne, the crowne of twelve ſtarres, and the Moone trode under the foote,</hi> chap, 12.1. For with all this glory shined that firſt moſt holy Church, or elſe wee can not finde to what times wee may referre it. But of what ſort I pray you, is this ſpace of two and fourty moneths? Namely of a moſt waſte wilderneſſe, of ſackcloth, uncleenes, corruption, and lamentable deformity. As touching that the wordes are expreſſe, <hi>that this wonder appeared in heaven, where after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Dragon warred: at length throwne headlong from thence,</hi> chap. 12.7. &amp;c. But what had the Dragon to doe in heaven, but that he might lie in waite for the woman travailing with childe? From whence alſo did the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man flee, if shee dwelt in the wildernes before the time of her travell? Whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, from the wildernes into the wildernes? But all the errour is from hence, becauſe the wildernes is not defined by his proper markes. For this wildernes is not the want of humane and extern comfort, but of the gifts of the holie Ghoſt; with which the firſt Church abounding moſt largely, felt not any deſert place, although wholly deſtitute of all humane ſuccour. Shee was indeede very greatly afflicted by the cruelty of the Emperours,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:6819:156"/> but the Dragon caſting the third part of the ſtarres to the earth tooke not heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from her, neither ſpoiled her of the clothing of the Sunne, although he deprived almoſt an infinite number of Saincts of their bodies. For her dignity is not to be meaſured by an outward pompe and ſhewe, but by true faith and pureneſſe of the whole worship of God, in both which ſhee then flouriſhed very greatly in compariſon of all other ages. It being now knowen for certaine to what both time and place, theſe moneths belong, to wit, to flight, wilderneſſe, privie places to hide in, neither to the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning, but after a longe and moſt grievous battell with the Dragon, in chap. 12.6. it muſt needes be that ſeeing theſe things are attributed to the Beaſt chap. 13.5. that it is alſo a living creature of ſome wilderneſſe, (and what other place is fit for wilde beaſts dennes? from whence ſhee is ſeen afterward more clearly in the wildernes, chap 17.3.) and that it is not the firſt, that is, <hi>the Romane Empire,</hi> but the ſecond enemy, to wit, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> who in as much as he could, would make this place of refuge to the woman, dangerous. From which thinges it is apparant, howe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde it is to ende theſe moneths in the death of <hi>Licinius,</hi> to wit, ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after their beginning. Which may yet more appeare, if wee shall min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de this terme of time being given them, that the whole ſixt trumpet alſo is concluded almoſt with the ſame boundes: for when theſe are finished, there remaineth a very little of this. How then is not the myſtery of God finiſhed, as is foretold in chap. 10.7. yf the ſeventh trumpet hath ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nowe ſo many ages, to wit, theſe thouſand three hundred yeeres more or leſſe a very little? Not but that wee knowe, that a thouſand yeeres are even as one day to God, 2 Pet. 3.8. But becauſe it ſeemeth ſtrange, that when the ſeven ſeales and ſixe trumpets are finished in one three hundred yeeres, that nowe one of the ſame trumpets should not finde an ende in foure times three hundred yeeres and more. But there is noe ſuch unequal difference of the ſacred Prophecy. This monſtrous proportion, whatſoever it ſeemeth to be, is nothing elſe but humane folly, &amp; not a right dividing of the times. Neither is that firme, that noe certaine time of domeſticall calamityes is ſignifyed no where in the Scriptures: for Numb. 14.33.34. 2 Sam. 24.13.14. 2 King. 8.1. and other the like, which might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, wil prove the contrary. Therefore that I may conclude the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing the ſeales doe leade unto Conſtantine himſelfe, and theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths are of a longer time, then all the trumpets that are paſt, of right doe wee iudge that they take their beginning in the ſixt ſeale, where heaven de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted away, chap. 6.14. Why should not the woman conſider of newe places to abide in, when the former were gone away, &amp; come to nothing?
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:6819:156"/> And when Diocletian, and Maximianus gave over the Empire of their owne accord, the Dragon was throwne downe from heaven, to wit, in the yeere of the Lord 304. when the deſired peace began to be given to the Church, and the Soveraignty to fall to Conſtantine, and of an exceeding great company of Chriſtians in name, a fewe elect were ſealed, chap. 7. Which things being thus layd, from neceſſary principles, I hope that now a large entrance is made to the finding out of the trueth of thoſe thinges which follow.</p>

                  <hi>¶ And I will give to my two witneſſes:</hi> Theod. Beza hath, <hi>But I will give it to my two witneſſes,</hi> as if the holy city should he given to them, which should appertaine to the <hi>Gentils,</hi> not to the witneſſes, who should have place with the reſt of the Saincts in the Temple. Therefore wee muſt read as it is in the Greeke, <hi>But I will give to my two witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. In which wordes he turneth him ſelfe nowe to the chiefe members of the holy Church, when hitherto he had declared ſummarily the things that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the whole body both of the <hi>true</hi> &amp; <hi>falſe</hi> Church. Nowe theſe wordes <hi>I will give and they ſhall prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy,</hi> are the ſame with theſe, <hi>J will give power, I will appoint, or I will commaunde them to prophecy,</hi> as <hi>Ioſuah gave them that ſame day to be hewers of wood,</hi> that is, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that day appointed them to hewe wood, Ioſ. 9.27. ſee the 1. chap. ver. 1. But the meaning is not to be ſtayed in the office of prophecying, as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh they should prophecy in thoſe dayes only, which is their continual du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, but that they should doe it all that time clothed in ſackcloth. The old Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers being farther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of theſe things thought that Enoch &amp; Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah being theſe 2 witneſſes, should come to fight with Antichr. in the laſt ti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes. But wee beholding the thing done now long agoe, may ſurely iudge, that the Spirit hath another meaning. The Papiſts with great applauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; make much of it, obtruding it upon the world as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: to it becauſe it carrieth men away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the things, a thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to them in all their expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; for the which they ſweate much. But the peculiar expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the things will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly their ſtiffenes in that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore that I may diſpatch it in a word, wee gather that theſe <hi>two Prophets are the holy ſcriptures, &amp; the aſſemblies of the faithfull</hi> Wee will render a reaſon after in the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Although everie one may ſee at the firſt ſight how fit both are for this office. <hi>The Scriptures beare witneſſe of the trueth,</hi> Ioh. 5.39. And the ſaincts <hi>doe praiſe the power of God</hi> &amp; <hi>declare his goodnes,</hi> as every where in the Pſalmes. A perſon is attributed to the Scriptures, after that manner, wherby the adioincts are ſignifyed from the ſubiects, as Moſes for the Lawe &amp;c. Then which kinde of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, there is nothing more commonly uſed.</p>

               <p>Before the type of them was the Sunne, but ſeeing there was here mention made of <hi>warre, of death, of the reſurrection,</hi> a perſon neceſſary, which should be capable of thoſe things. From whence there is this newe way of ſignifying an olde thinge. The time how long they ſhould prophcy is limi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted with <hi>a thouſand two hundreth and three ſcore dayes,</hi> altogither the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me with the two and fourty moneths before. To what ende then doth he nowe devide it by little parts into <hi>dayes,</hi> &amp; not declare it briefly by <hi>moneths</hi> as before? To wit becauſe the office of prophecying is ſuch, that they muſt take paines in it continually without ceaſing, not by a ſtinted labour every three moneths, foure times in the yeere, or peradventure ſomewhat more diligently once every moneth, but wherein wee muſt continue alwayes as in a watchtower, leaſt the enemy continually lying in waite, come unloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for upon us ſleeping or being abſent. Moreover that wee should ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledg the ſingular providence of God towards his holy ſervants, which at all occaſions is ready, both to deliver them from evill, and alſo to ſtore them with good things. For the ſame reaſon <hi>he helde the Angels in his hande,</hi> chap. 1.20. and the Pſalmiſt ſingeth, <hi>The keeper of Iſraell ſlumbereth not,</hi> Pſ. 121.4. Finally that he may shewe that the moneths are not to be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred in a generall maner, but every day by it ſelfe a part, as wee have ſaid before. Sacks are the cloathing wherein they should prophecy, becauſe they should execute their office, vilely arayed, clad in mourning apparell, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of all luſtre, in the ſame garment that is wont to be uſed in lamenting. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was this ſorrofull arraying in that triumphe which the Church made under Conſtantine? Surely, although great was the glory of peace, honours, dignityes, riches, wherewith he endowed moſt nobly, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Churches, yet as touching true godlineſſe, all things began to be farre worſe. The Heaven departed away under Diocletian by an horrible tempeſt of perſecution, but nowe it was corrupted more with tranquility, then when the cruell enemy was at hande to take away their lives. For nowe the ſimple purity of the Scriptures began to be troubled more and more, the meaning of them not be underſtood, to be wreſted by allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and abſurd expoſitions, and any thing almoſt to be added unto them which mens phantaſie would. Did not the Arian faction, which wee heard in chap. 8, 10.11. infect the third part of the rivers and fountaines with her wormwood, ſtrive to drawe the Scripture to their ſide, and by their au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority to proffer their wicked opinions to the world? So all Heretiques for the moſt parte are wont to doe, but the governement of the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te was never added before, to the furthering of ſo wicked opinion. The Scriptures then for good cauſe did put on ſackecloath, when they were
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:6819:157"/> conſtrained ſo againſt their meaning to defende and ſtablish thoſe errours which they hated chiefly and above all things. Nevertheleſſe they were not covered by and by with this mourning apparell, but they began in that ioy fulneſſe to change the garment, which they afterwards did openly weare. That, and the ages comming after had indeede ſome learned and holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but theſe were both fewe, and alſo every one knoweth, how great a blemiſh the corruption of the times did caſt upon them. Indeede in their conflict againſt the Heretiques, they poliſhed the trueth moſt ſubtilly: but their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes being voide of this care, did for the moſt part much erre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the marke. Although the gowne was then alſo ſpotleſſe in compariſon of thoſe uncleanneſſes wherewith afterward the trueth of God was ſtained: the honouring and worshipping of reliques defiled the aſſemblyes alſo of the faithfull, and religion being put in holy places, and times, and other frivolous &amp; trifling things of that ſorte, clothed them as it were with ſacke For the beautifull attire of theſe, is when they ſhine in the ſimplicitie of Gods ordinance. But the ages following did more deface them with duſt and aſhes, wherewith at length they being wholly covered, they could be knowne to God onely, unknowne altogither to others by their true fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. <hi>It is a thing certenly to be wondered at, that the Church ſhould under the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of the Emperours ſhine with the cloathing of the Sunne, but in the cleere skie of her foſter father, ſhoulbe cloathed in ſackecloath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Theſe are thoſe two olive trees:</hi> There is a double property of the Prophets, one <hi>of bountifulneſſe towards their owne,</hi> that I may ſo ſay, in this verſe: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>of power over their enemyes,</hi> as in deſtroying them, in the fift verſe, ſo in troubling them with other evils in the ſixt verſe. As touching their <hi>bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,</hi> they are <hi>two olive trees,</hi> and <hi>two candleſtickes:</hi> the type being taken out of Zach. 4.2.12. and very fit for theſe things in hande. For ever as then God did preſerve his Church, and adorne it with the gifts of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and beſtoweth them moſt liberally upon the ſame, not ſo much by the miniſtery of men, as by his alone ſupernall grace beyond all mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which thing the oyle ſignifyed, gotten not by mens induſtry, but na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turally flowing out of the olive berries into the oyle cruet of the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickes: ſo nowe he would defende the Church being in danger, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve to himſelfe ſome burning candleſticks, to which how ſoever oyle preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and wrong out of the wine preſſe should be wanting, he himſelfe never<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>theleſſe would plant them hard by the olive trees, which of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and continually dropping out of the berries into the lampes, ſhould miniſter perpetuall nourriſhement to the flame wich is to be maintained. Seeing therefore that in this type the gifts of the Spirit are ſhadowed out,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6819:158"/> the inward, by the flame of the Candleſtickes, the outward by the olive trees, among which, the chiefe is the ſacred word, not without cauſe theſe olive trees, from whoſe berries oyle is powred to nourish the flame of the candleſtickes, may ſignify the Scriptures, whoſe office is to miniſter doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne to the Prophets, that they may nourish the flame of Godlineſſe in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their auditours. For like raiſon, for which they were compared before to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> both being miniſters of light: this of his owne, thoſe in ſtirring up a flame by a fit nourishment. Now they are two, in reſpect of the old and newe teſtament: <hi>God ſpake in olde time by the Prophets, but now by his Sonne,</hi> Heb. 1.1. There are alſo <hi>two</hi> in Zacharie, before the Goſpell was written: yet it hindereth not the application, ſeeing it was always in force, before it was written. For there are two chiefe points of the whole ſacred doctrine: the Lawe, and the Ghoſpell, which are thoſe wholeſome olive trees, and alwaies have belonged to all times. The Candleſtickes doe carrie the candles ſet in them, by which Chriſt hath taught expreſſely that the Churches are noted, chap. 1.20. To wit, becauſe they shew the office of a candleſticke, in the top of which the Prophets being ſet, not in the high toppe of wordly dignity, doe communicate their wholeſome light to the Saincts. The Prophets the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves are the <hi>Candles,</hi> not the Candleſtickes, as Chriſt diſtinguisheth them, <hi>neither doe men light a candle and ſet it under a buſhell, but on a candleſticke, and it giveth light to all which are in the houſe,</hi> Mat. 5.15.</p>
               <p>And before he ſaid that the ſtarres are miniſters, where he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Churches unto candleſtickes in the firſt chapter, and twentieth ver. But why are they now but two? Doubtleſſe moſt fitly for the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, which had ſufferred a pitifull loſſe of the reſt. In the firſt chapter there were ſeven, to wit, ſo many as are the branches of one: after the ſimilitude of the candleſticke in the temple, which repreſenting the Church <hi>had one ſhafte onely, but ſeven branches coming out of the ſides,</hi> Exod. 25.31. &amp;c. For there is one Catholique Church, as <hi>one ſhafte:</hi> but the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticular congregations are many: which comming forth out of that one, and abiding in the ſame, as the divers branches of one ſhafte do ſtay as it were upon the ſame baſe. Where thoſe <hi>firſt ſeven Candleſtickes</hi> shewed that there was then a moſt flouriſhing Church, as long as the Apoſtles and their next true ſucceſſours did burne as it were candles in the ſame.</p>
               <p>But at this time, wherein the PROPHETS ſhould goe clad in mour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning apparell: the <hi>Candleſtickes are but two,</hi> which lacke five to make up their full number: becauſe the dignity of it was much diminished, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:6819:158"/> brought to an extreme condition. Nevertheleſſe the elect should have ſome fatneſſe as it were of the olive trees, wherby they should cherish the celeſtiall flame in their hearts: neither should a candleſticke be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, from whence the Miniſters should give light aboundantly, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the companies of the faithfull should be moſt rare and very ſmall. Theſe thinges yet hitherto doe not peradventure content our mindes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſeeing in this ſpace of a thouſande two hundreth and three ſcore dayes (which wee have shewed to be ſo many yeeres, and to have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the yeere 304) wee have taught that ſixe Antitype candieſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes did shine, chap. 2.3.</p>
               <p>So then I thinke, that the three laſt, the Sarden, Philadelphien, Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen, were not kindled, but after a thouſande two hundred, and almoſt twenty yeeres: and therefore worthily not to come into any accounte, to which ſo ſmall a number of thoſe dayes agreeth.</p>
               <p>But as touching the other three, the Smyrnen belonged to the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying, the Thyatiren to the ſame riſing againe: but the Pergamen lying in a moſt deepe pit of all corruption, from it is neither of any reckening but of ſet purpoſe paſſed over. Not that there should be none at all in that ſtate of things, but becauſe none should be greatly in ſight at that time.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And yf any will hurte them:</hi> Nowe followeth the power to deſtroy the enemies. But why are they clothed in ſackcloth but for iniurie received? Doe they then deſtroy the worlde with fire, doing wronge daily unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Iniurie is double, one more grievous done adviſedly eyther by open for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or fraude: an other leſſe of ignorance and lacke of heed taking. They ſeeme to have worne ſackecloth becauſe of this ſecond kinde: in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne while continually punishing their more deadly enemies with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire. It is ſaid to come out of their mouth, by whoſe threatning &amp; prayers ſuch a iudgement is exerciſed. Even as in olde time at the ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before of Moſes, <hi>a fire comming from the Lord conſumed the two hundred &amp; fifty men, which roſe up againſt him with Corah,</hi> Numb. 16. Or as at the <hi>prayers of Eliah fire came from heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; conſumed the Captaine &amp; his 50 men, which Acha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſia ſent to kill him,</hi> 2 Kings 1. God defendeth theſe Prophets after the ſame maner, that he did thoſe auncient ones: yea rather he will have theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in a more notable manner, by how much he regardeth more his owne trueth, and whole aſſemblyes of the Saincts, then ſingular perſons. The Holy SCRIPTVRES therefore, pronouncing moſt certen puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments againſt all ungodlines, and tranſgreſsion, doe ſende, as it were, fire out of their mouth, whereby they doe utterly conſume and devoure the unrepentant.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:6819:159"/>
               <p>For it cannot be, <hi>that one tittle of Gods word ſhould periſh,</hi> Mat. 24.35. But chiefly they doe <hi>vomit fire upon them, who will hurt them,</hi> that is, who dare cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupt their moſt ſyncere trueth by humane inventions patched unto it, threatning that, <hi>Jf any man ſhall adde unto this Prophecy, that God will lay upon him the plagues that are written in that booke,</hi> chap. 22.18.19. Not becauſe they doe eſtime the ſacred authority of the Revelation onely ratifyed by ſo great a punishement: but becauſe there is the ſame regard of the whole trueth inſpired of God, as <hi>Yee ſhall put nothing to this word which I ſpeake unto you, neither ſhall yee take away therefrom,</hi> Deut. 4.2. <hi>Put nothing to his wordes, leaſt thou be reproved, &amp; founde a lyar:</hi> Pr. 30.6.

Therefore theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets being ſo evill intreated, <hi>burnt up the third part of trees, and all green gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with fire mingled with haile: killed the third part of the creatures which were in the Sea by a burning mountaine caſt into it: turned the rivers and fountaines into worme wood, by a ſtarre that fell, and did burne like a torch: yea they gave power to ſende the Locuſts and the Euphratean Angells,</hi> as hath ben declared already in the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets: from every one of which, either <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>helliſh ſmoke</hi> did iſſue forth. All which evils wer no other thing then the flame going out of the mouth of the Prophets, ſorely punishing the wicked contemners of the trueth. There is the ſame reaſon of the Candleſtickes, that is, of the aſſemblies of the Saincts: For God ſufferreth not the Churches to be oppreſſed without rewarding the wicked, but moved with the prayers of it, requireth meete punishements of the oppreſſours. Diocletian giving over the Empire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſpende the reſt of his life quietly. But he eſcaped not ſo. For his houſe being wholly conſumed with lightning, and bright burning fire that fell from heaven, he for feare of the lightening hiding himſelfe, dyed ſhortly after. So <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> himſelfe hath writen in his booke, commonly called the <hi>fift booke of Euſebius, of the life of Conſtantine, leafe 168.</hi> Although Euſebius, Nicephorus, and others, doe tell of a farre more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible death. <hi>Maximinian Hercule</hi> his conpartner died his wezand being broken with an halter. <hi>Maxentius</hi> his ſonne was drowned in the river Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>Galerius</hi> is deſtroyed by horrible torment of diſeaſes. <hi>Maximinus</hi> alſo is taken away in the ſame manner: <hi>Lucinius</hi> often overcome, and often put to flight, at length is killed. What should I recite others? <hi>Valens</hi> fighting

But theſe were but alone perſons: but alſo the whole multitude were ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and very ſorely punished by famine, peſtilence, and warre, as might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared plenteouſly, but that it would be longe, and not greatly needfull. Theſe thinges may shewe ſufficiently that howſoever theſe <hi>Prophets</hi> might then ſeeme to be <hi>wretched, raged, and vilely apparelled,</hi> were yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding armed with a power not to be deſpiſed The ſame is the condition of the reſt of the Prophets</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Theſe have power to ſhutte heaven:</hi> He cometh to another very great pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, and wonderfull, wherein they are equall to the olde even the chiefe Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets. Renowmed is Eliah, at whoſe praiers God did shut the heaven, ſo <hi>that for three yeeres and ſixe moneths: the earth was not watered with any ſhowre of raine,</hi> 1 King. 18.1. Luke 4.25. But wee have not reade any ſuch thing done of theſe Prophets. It is true it may be, if wee take the wordes proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but if wee transferre them to ſpirituall things, after the manner of other thinges, which have ben ſpoken before, how great a proportion shall wee finde? That drouth was for three yeeres and ſixe moneths at the prayer of <hi>Eliah;</hi> ſo the time of this power granted to theſe Prophets should be for ſo many great yeeres and moneths. For two and fourty moneths, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and three ſcore dayes doe fulfill this diſtance of yeeres and moneths: but great ones as I have ſaid, and hath ben already proved ſufficiently before, not thoſe common ones ſuch as were thoſe of Eliah, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one containing three hundred three ſcore common yeeres: and the halfe one hundred and foure ſcore yeeres. How great drouth, and lack of ſpirituall dewe was there all this time, through want of which, godlineſſe withered in every place? But they that bring every thing to the letter, and will have the <hi>three yeeres and an halfe</hi> to be meant of common yeeres, doe they dreame alſo of ſuch a ſtaying of rayne, which they muſt needes doe? Surely they get for Antichriſt a Kingdome ill favoured, hungerſtarven, every way wretched, and unhappy: altogither contrary to that exceſſe, wherewith the Spirit ſaith that he should abounde. Neither shall Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt have any leaſure to carrie about armour to ſubdue the nations, but rather shall leave droves of beaſts and cattell to the water, as wee read that Ahab did long ſince. But it is no marvell that they fall into many ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd things, who had rather followe their owne conceived opinions, then the trueth it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they have power over waters:</hi> As Moſes, who <hi>turned the waters of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt into blood:</hi> and as theſe Prophets have done in very deede, when the

                  <hi>¶ Shall make warre againſt them:</hi> Shall the <hi>Beaſt</hi> now firſt of all call unto wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pons? He shall aſſay to doe violence <hi>the whole thouſand two hundred threeſcore dayes,</hi> chap. 13.5. But this battell which he shall make when that time is finished, deſerveth before others the name of warre, both for the very kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of preparation and hoſtile cruelty, and alſo for the notorious ſlaughter done to the Prophets. And the thing it ſelfe proveth that at this very time there was very little warre. For as touching <hi>the Scriptures</hi> the Councill at Trent began in the yeere 1546, the 7 day of February, to wit, after thoſe thouſand two hundreth and three ſcore dayes were ended, in their third ſeſsion the eight daye of Aprill, pierced and murdered them moſt pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>For here the Hebrewe and Greeke fountaines were refuſed, and the Latine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tranſlation eſtabliſhed for Authentique. Here unwritten traditions were placed in equall dignity with the Holy Scriptures: Here the Interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ptures was taken away from the Scriptures, and made ſubiect to mens pleaſure but chiefly to the Popes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ever ſince the world began the Holy and Sacred Scriptures were not ſo much abuſed both openly and by publique authority. ANTIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHVS in deede a good while ſince inflicted a grievous wounde in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the Holy Bookes to be burnt in the fire: Likewiſe DIOCLE<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>TIAN, and other Tyrants.</p>
               <p>But the iniurie of theſe <hi>TRIDENTINE FATHERS,</hi> is farre more grievous. For they were Ethniques, enemies ſtricken with a certen fury and madnes, wholly repugnant to all the trueth. Theſe alone wilbe counted <hi>CATHOLIQVES, very great and chiefe friends, the thing a long time, and much conſulted of, guided by mature and ripe iudgement, the very PIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARS and upholders of the TRVETH,</hi> and upon whom noe ſpotte of errour can be caſt.</p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:6819:161"/>
               <p>How muſt it needs be, that their act was of no authority, and theſe men of very great? neither is there cauſe why any should obiect Marcion, the Eucratites, Cataphrygians, and ſuch monſters, of which ſome reiected one part <hi>of the ſacred Scriptures</hi> and ſome another, at their pleaſure. There is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great difference as touching the greatnes of the hurt, betweene the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of obſcure Heretiques, and the deliberat actes and Decrees of an ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Councell, eſpecially which chalengeth to it ſelfe to be credited with out exception. It is therefore a thing eſpecially worthy remembrance and worthy that the Church should be put in minde of by ſo notable a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy. The event and time doe conſent ſo wonderfully, that every equall arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratour will eaſily acknowledge, that I have not willfully ſought this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, but that I have ben lead as it were by the hande, to the ſame by the very order and diſpoſition of the matters. As touching the <hi>aſſemblyes of the faithfull,</hi> which in theſe laſt times did firſt appeare in Germany, they were aſſailed with a moſt cruell warre the ſame yeere. <hi>The ſame Beaſt</hi> made this warre likewiſe by <hi>the help of the Emperour Charles the fift:</hi> otherwiſe a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man greatly to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but obeying the Pope too much through the common errour of the Princes. From whence not without cauſe, that is attributed to one, which being proceeded from two or more, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding is done by one ioint endevour. The overthrowe in this warre was received about the two and twentieth day of Aprill in the yeere follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, to wit, 1547, when the armies of the Proteſtans were put to flight, &amp; Iohn Frederike Duke of Saxonie himſelfe, Erneſtus of Brunſwick the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves ſonne, and not very long after the Lantgrave himſelfe were taken. Which calamity ſtayed not in theſe fewe, but alſo afflicted many others, both Governours and Cityes, which partly yeelded themſelves of their owne accord, partly were wonne by force. <hi>In one moment,</hi> ſayth Beza, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling the miſery of that time, <hi>ſeemed to be overthrowne, whatſoever had ben builded up in ſo many yeeres, and with ſo great labours: and they onely were counted happy of the moſt part, whom ſudden death had taken away from theſe hurlie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> ſuch are his wordes. The remembrance of that time is ſorrowfull to all the godly: when the holy and wiſe Princes inflamed with a deſire onely to defende the trueth, not themſelves alone, but the Churches togither with them, which as newly borne, did lament among the weapons, came miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably into the power of the enemies. But now was the time of darkeneſſe, in which theſe two Prophets muſt be killed, and made a mocking ſtock. Although wee muſt reioice in the ſame adverſities, which ar a calling to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrance of the divine Prophecies, confirming certenly the confidence and faith of our hope, as ſaith Tertullian in his Apologie.</p>

For <hi>their pierced corpſes are caſt forth into the ſtreetes of the great city,</hi> that they might be a ſpectacle to all men, and an ornament to the triumphe of the <hi>Romiſh Beaſt.</hi> And what other thing <hi>of theſe Scriptures</hi> now remained, <hi>then a very karkeiſe, wholly without all authoritie, power, and life, when all interpretation was brought to the Apoſtolique Chaire,</hi> neither might they mutter any thing at all, which the Bishop of Rome should not breath into them? The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaketh ſo exactly, that he may leave them noe tergiverſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He knew that the Pope of Rome, whatſoever he should doe againſt the truth, would boaſt nevertheleſſe, that to him nothing is better, of more account, and more inviolable then the Scriptures themſelves. But that noe man may be deceived with a bare name, the Spirit ſpeaketh evidently, that after the <hi>Tridentine Councill,</hi> noe Scriptures should be in the poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but a dead carkeiſe of noe ſtrenght and power.</p>

                  <hi>¶ In the ſtreetes of the great citie, which ſpiritually is called Sodome and Egypt;</hi> This great City is that whole dominion of which Rome is the mother Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: in which ſenſe the tenth part of the city falleth after in the 13 verſe. A <hi>ſtreet</hi> is ſome part of the Romane dition, wherein this ſpectacle is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be ſeene, the ioy whereof ſpreadeth it ſelfe through the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But the <hi>great citie</hi> it ſelfe togither with her chiefe citie is deſcribed in the reſt of the verſe, and that by two expreſſe names, a notable marke alſo being added, leaſt any perhaps should miſtake the city. And alſo for a grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter aſſurance wee are admonished that theſe names are not to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but ſpiritually, that is, aenigmatically, figuratively, allegorically. The firſt name is <hi>Sodom,</hi> a city once very famous for her filthines, nowe for her punishement, a moſt fit exemple of the tower and chiefe habitation of this great citie. For is not the city Rome become famous for her horrible luſts, above all the whole world: In the iudgement of all the Poete Mantu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an hath truly ſonge of her in theſe wordes;

                     <l>The ſame corrupted filthines: Rome now is all a Stewes.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Which is no leſſe declared by an other taking his leave of Rome, thus;

                     <l>Jle come againe when bawd, I meane, knave, brothel, beaſt, to be.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But that you may the better acknowledge Sodome, heare what a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:6819:162"/> man anſwered to one asking a queſtion touching Rome:
<q>
                     <l>Say, what is Roma? <hi>Amor,</hi> Love; if backward you it ſpell:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hath not Hieronymus Zeged Mutius declared this plainely in his Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicall bookes defending this horrible villany, and approved by the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and lettres patents of Iulius the third him ſelfe. With whom <hi>Iohannes Caſa</hi> aſſociated himſelfe, being Archbiſhop of Beneventum, but a bird of the ſame foule neaſt, greatly extolling that thing, which peradventure So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would have ben ashamed of. But it would be an infinite and irkeſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me thing oven briefly to touch thoſe thinges, which might be ſpoken of this matter. Thyne opprobrious luſts O Rome, have taken away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch from thy Brothel houſes, which the moſt holy Father cheriſheth in his boſome by a wiſe pollicy, to wit for the avoiding of a greater evill: but while he pretendeth to avoide, by the iuſt iudgement of God he runneth headlong into more grievous, being <hi>given over into a reprobate ſenſe:</hi> Rom. 1.26.27. as it may be manifeſt to all men, who are not willingly blinde. And noe leſſe is Rome a ſpirituall Sodome, then a corporall mother and a ſhoppe of all monſtrous Idolatry, as of the worship of the breaden Maſſe God, of Images, of Reliques, &amp; other moſt wicked impurity of that ſorte, as is more knowen to all men, then that it needeth wordes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond name is <hi>Aegypt,</hi> not any city, like Sodome, but a whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey and Province. From whence this name is not proper to the mother ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty it ſelfe, but common to that whole dominion, declaring moſt plainely the diſpoſition of the whole Kingdome of the Papiſts, on which ſide ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her large poſſeſsions doe extende. For it sheweth noe leſſe the notable ſpirituall fornication committed alway throughout this whole Empire, then Sodome declareth the bodily and ſpirituall, practized continually in the city of Rome. It is reported of many, howe great the blindeneſſe of Aegypt was longe a goe, both in worshipping a multitude of Gods, &amp; alſo in adoring moſt baſe &amp; filthy things, to wit, Cartes, Crocodiles, and other things of that kinde. Spirituall Aegypt with all her provinces aboundeth in noe leſſe ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, nor of more vile Gods; wherto perteined the rehearſing of ſo divers Images, before chap. 9.20. and the cleare teſtimony of daily practiſe maketh it manifeſt. For whither can you turne your eyes, where you may not ſee windowes, walles, lofts, full of a multitude of their Gods? What temple can you goe unto, where you may not finde ſuch as worship every day their breaden God? And as if Idols inough did not ſtand out in a publique place, to ſatiate their ſpirituall luſt, they get privately for them ſelves Crucifixes, and Agnos Deiſes, which they hide in their boſome, that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:6819:162"/> they may never be without ſome thing, with which they may defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in whoredome. It was an horrible thing once <hi>to have increaſed their Gods according to the number of their cityes,</hi> Ier. 11.13. But in this Kingdome they have multiplyed their Gods, according to the number almoſt of the perſons. And whither is it leſſe impious and filthy, religiouſly to worſhip a certen foreskinne, a ſhirt, breeches, a little braine, bones, peticoates, gir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dles, ſhooes, and infinite ſuch other thinges, then a cowe, a catte, Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile &amp;c. The Idolatry is not to be eſteemed ſo much the leſſe, by how much the excellency of the thing which is worshiped is greater: for when one hath ben ſacrilegious once againſt God, in attributing to the creature that which is proper to him, it is as well Idolatry to worship the higheſt Angels as the loweſt, vileſt, and moſt abiect creeping thing. Neither is it Aegypt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone becauſe of Idolatry, but alſo for the notable cruelty, wherby the ove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fornace became nothing milder to the true faithfull, then Aegypt was once to the Iſraelites. Such are the names: the <hi>Property</hi> belongeth to the place where <hi>our Lord was crucifyed:</hi> but <hi>ubi</hi> being put without interrogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſendeth us back to ſome former thing ſet downe in the ſentence, that is to ſay, unto <hi>ſpirituall Aegypt.</hi> For the Lord was not crucifyed in Aegypt taken properly, but in that ſpirituall one, whoſe whole lande, dominion, &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is full of cruelty and Idolatry. Great is the force therefore of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which bringeth thoſe former common names of <hi>Sodome</hi> &amp; <hi>Aegypt</hi> to a ſtriecter and ſure way. For there are many cities abominable for mon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrous luſts. Many alſo whoſe outward power over the people, farre and neere, reſpecteth nothing ſo much as to practiſe and ſtabliſh Idolatry. But that <hi>Sodome</hi> which is alſo <hi>ſpirituall Aegypt,</hi> and that Aegypt within whoſe boundes and Empire <hi>the Lord was crucifyed,</hi> can be no other, then one defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, moſt manifeſt and certenly knowne. From this light therefore any man may perceave moſt clearly, what that city is, which hath killed theſe two Prophets, and in whoſe ſtreetes they lay unburied. For that city which by her chiefe city is ſpiritually <hi>Sodome,</hi> in her whole dominion <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> in which dominion <hi>the Lord was crucifyed,</hi> is <hi>the city</hi> that hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this vilanie againſt the two Prophets. But noe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can doubt, but that very Rome is Sodome, both ſpiritually and bodily: and in her whole King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome Aegypt, and that under the power of this Kingdome the Lord was crucifyed. <hi>For they ſhall deliver him to the Gentiles,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>that they may mock, and ſcourge, and crucify him,</hi> Mat. 20.19. That noe man may thinke that he was hanged on croſſe by the power of the iudges. Which thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the very Iewes acknowledged ſaying, <hi>it is not lawfull for us to put any man to death,</hi> Iohn 18.31. Therefore <hi>Pilate</hi> the Romane Pretor, exerciſing the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane iuriſdiction in Iudea, condemning Chriſt unto the croſſe and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:6819:163"/> the ſentence given by his ſouldiers, crucifyed the L. in ſpirituall Aeg. the Rom. kingdome being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heathenish, &amp; defyled with foule Idolatry. From which thinges it is to be obſerved, that theſe two Prophets were not to be ſlaine in the ſame ſpeciall City, where the Lord was crucifyed, but in the ſame <hi>ſpirituall Egypt,</hi> an ample and ſpatious country, conteining not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely many ſpeciall cityes, but alſo a great number of Provinces. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Bellarmine avoucheth fooliſhly, that the two prophets were to be killed at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as if they who are killed in ſome one moſt mighty Kingdome, muſt needs all be killed in one and the ſame city of that Kingdome. More over thou mayeſt obſerve, that the Popiſh Rome is no leſſe ſpirituall Egypt in her dominion, then was before time that Heatheniſh, howſoever the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites will have them to be moſt unlike. But let them now goe, &amp; reioyce greatly in that place: and let Bellarmine bragge, that Chytreus and other of our men doe paſſe over theſe wordes with ſilence, having as it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwere to theſe things. I hope that their Rome shalbe founde here farre more clearly, then that either he or any other of his company can be able to take out of our ſight by any darkenes of theirs.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of <hi>three dayes and an halfe</hi> taketh not his beginning before the thouſand two hundred and threeſcore daies be accomplished. For ſo before in ver. 7. <hi>And when they have finiſhed:</hi> Afterward, <hi>theſe three daies and an halfe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phets lay ſlaine and unburied.</hi> But that <hi>ſpace of a thouſand two hundreth and three ſcore daies, is a time of Prophecying in ſackcloth:</hi> ſo as by no meanes they can be referred to the ſame time. Let us therefore give unto them their owne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and ſet them next to <hi>the moneths.</hi> Which after the likenes of the former dayes, doe ſignify three yeeres and an halfe: in which the Papiſts ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioyce in their owne behalfe, for that the Scriptures were vanquished, and

There after the deadly ſentence was given againſt the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the yeere 1546, the 8. of Aprill, from thence for three whole yeeres and an halfe, the Fathers triumphed in the mixed aſſembly of all nations, as if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had ben executed manfully and excellently, and prepared themſelves to ſuppreſſe the reſt of the trueth, untill at length by the death of Paul the third, the Conventicle was interrupted. Which thing fell on the yeere 1549. the 9. of November, that is, on the third yeere and an halfe after <hi>the Scriptures were trode under foote.</hi> The very fewe weekes that remaine hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the agreement, ſeeing the Spirit thought not good to devide the matter into ſmaller portions, then into three daies and an halfe. In Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many the Church, which by the confederate armies of the Emperour and Pope, ſeemed to have ben put downe for ever in mens opinion, lay as it were halfe dead for the ſame ſpace, to wit, from 22. of Aprill in the yeere 1547, unto the firſt day of October of the yeere 1550. when at Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg it began to lift up the head againe, being nothing afraid neither of the Emperours proſcription, or conſpiracie of the Princes, or whatſoever any enemies could doe againſt them, Sleid. booke 22. and 23.

But in what a chafe was the Bishop of Artois, when the men of Auſpurg, Trevers and Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſell alledged for their excuſe, that they had not receaved the forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, becauſe it diſagreeth from the ſacred ſcripture? <hi>Doe you thinke,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the Emperour may not make lawes, and preſcribe a certen rule, as of civill, ſo alſo of holy thinges?</hi> Sleid. booke 23. In the very Councell of Trent, what in the name of the reſt a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwereth Pictavius to the Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilane Ambaſſadours?
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:6819:164"/> For when they required that the ſame order might be taken for them, which before time was for the Bohemians, according to the forme of the decree of Baſell: <hi>That the Scriptures in every controverſy might be in ſtead of a iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge: Pictavius obiected to them againe, that the Scripture was a vaine and du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be thing, as alſo are the other politique lawes:, and that unto it muſt be added the voice of the Iudge, that it may be wel underſtood,</hi> Sleid. booke 23. He graunteth that the Scripture nowe is nothing, but a vaine and dumbe thing, that is, altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a carkeiſe. And why should he not ſo boaſt, being privie to himſelfe, that it was lately ſlaine by his labour, and of the reſt of the Tridentine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? But while they deny to give this honour to the Scriptures, that they would not ſuffer them to obtaine that authority, which a fewe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned worshippers would have given them willingly, it was like as if they should forbidde their corpſes lately thruſt through pitifully, to be buried. Pilate, when Ioſeph &amp; Nicodemꝰ asked the body of Chriſt, gave them leav that they should beſtowe what coſt they would upon it. But when the Proteſtants made humble requeſt that they might at leaſt wiſe burie <hi>the car keiſes of the Scriptures</hi> among themſelves, although not in any ſolemne gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, but onely under the ſimple turffe of their cottages, <hi>the Scarlated Fathers</hi> denyed it ſtiffely. The Church was handled in the like manner. For after that the Duke of Saxonie and the Lantgrave were taken priſonners, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties put to a fine, and very many noble men utterly caſt out of favour, the Emperour proſcribeth the people of Maidenburge by writings ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the ſentence whereof after the uſuall forme is this: <hi>let noe man aide them by any meanes whatſoever, neither acquaint him ſelfe with their caſe: they which ſhall doe otherwiſe, ſhall put themſelves in perill of their goods and life.</hi> What is this elſe, then that noe man should dare to make the funerals of the w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retched Church cruelly murdered? Maidenburg was left as a remnant of the poore miſerable, where aſſemblies of the faithfull were kept. But might noe man helpe this firebrand reſerved from the burning, without danger of his life? Doubtleſſe it is apparant, ſeeing they ſuffered not the duties tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching burials to be performed to their ſlaine carkeiſes.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>And they that dwell upon the earth ſhall reioice over them:</hi> The citizens of the falſe Church, as before chap 7.1. &amp;c. Theſe should reioice over them and be glad, and should ſende gifts one to an other, as in common ioy. And ſurely not without cauſe, being nowe freed from the great trouble, wherewith <hi>the Scriptures and the moſt pure Churches,</hi> as tormenters and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners vexed them while they lived. Nothing is ſo grievous to the world, as that their uncleane luſts should be bridled, their filthines reprooved, &amp; all their actions tryed by the rule of the ſame trueth. But the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6819:164"/> now tyed to the interpretation of the Scriptures, that is, to the Pope of Rome: why should not the Papiſts hope, the Pope being of ſuch gentle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe to his ſervants, that they shall henceforth be no more made ſicke by the ſcriptures? Without doubt the moſt holy Father would ſmite out their teeth, leaſt perhaps they should reſtraine his little pretie darlings. A iuſt cauſe of exceeding ioy, and great triumphe.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>But after three dayes and an halfe:</hi> In the yeere 1550, the firſt day of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctobre, after three yeeres and an halfe from that deſtruction inferred upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Churches of Germany. For at this time the Prophets revived, and the eſtimation of <hi>the Scriptures,</hi> &amp; <hi>congregations of the faithfull</hi> increaſed, maugre Antichriſt, head and all enemies. For the people of Maidenburge, who all this time were proſcribed of the Emperour, and utterly deſtroyed in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s iudgement, a fewe daies before by George Megelburge: at length raiſing up themſelves, or rather ſtirred up of God, by a writing ſpread abroad, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify openly to the world, their unquailed courage, and invincible conſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy. They deteſt the Councell of Trent, and noe leſſe reiect the decree of Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſil, made by the Princes, and the Emperour himſelfe. They exhorte all to fortitude, and shewe themſelves to be ready, if neede shalbe, for this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe not to refuſe death. This ſurely was the Spirit of life, who comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God reſtored againe heart to the Church, ſet up on their feete the ſlaine Prophets, and endued them with ſuch courage, that they were ſtraiteway a terrour to the enemies. For beſide that bolde profeſsion, the authour whereof was the heavenly Spirit given to them, they ſtood on their feete in reſiſting valiantly Mauritius, who being ſent of the Emperour, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Captaine in that warre by publique authority, firſt aſſaulted them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fiercely. They tooke alſo that George Megelberge, &amp; kept him in their power in the Citie, who had lately given them a great overthrowe. And at length when they could not vanquish them by any force, peace being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de with Mauritius, they obtained a very famous name among forraine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe almoſt they alone of all the Germanes had taught by their example what conſtancy can effect. So therefore the Church nowe againe ſtood up on her feete. Which thing doubtleſſe put the enemies in very great feare. For as Sleidane writeth, <hi>That which was an ende of miſeries to the people of Maidenburg, was an entrance and beginning of warre againſt thoſe themſel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ves, by whoſe aide and councell they had ben afflicted.</hi> For Mauritius, partly to deliver the Lantgrave his father in lawe, partly to defende the trueth, and to have free leave to walke in it, which he ſawe to have ben holden under ſome ſpace of time by the iniuſtice of the enemies: prepared warre againſt the Emperour him ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:6819:165"/>
               <p>But how great trembling aroſe from hence? Firſt <hi>the Tridentine Fathers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> even a falſe rumour was brought them that the citie Auſpurge was taken, ſcarce taking their leave of the reſt of their fellowes in office ſlipped out &amp; ranne away. But when Mauritius proceeded, and approched Oenipous, where the Emperour himſelfe abode, he ſtrooke ſo great terrour into him, that he fled away ſuddenly with great ſpeed togither with his brother Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand. More over feare drove him againſt his will to give leave to depart to <hi>Iohn Friderike</hi> Duke of Saxonie, whom before wee ſaid to have ben taken priſonner, leaſt the enemie should referre it to his owne glory. Was this a ſmall feare, which made the Emperour, and the King of the Romanes to flee, and diſperſed the Tridentine aſſembly of Bishops? Nowe therefore feare came upon the enemies, that they should fly away as farre as they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from her ſight, whom of late they ſcoffed at without danger.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Afterward they heard a great voice from heaven;</hi> Aretas and Montanus read, <hi>and I heard a great voice from heaven ſaying to them, come up hither.</hi> To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcende into heaven, is after labours diſpatched, to be adorned with excee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding honour and glory: after the example of Chriſt, who after death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, was taken up into heaven. But whereas a voice was heard bidding them to <hi>come up,</hi> thereby is ſignifyed that the Prophets should not attaine to this honour by their owne power, but should be placed in that dignity, by the authority of other men, that is to ſay, by ſome decree of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As wee knowe it came to paſſe at Auſpurge the ſeaventh of the Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of October, in the yeere 1555: when by a publique decree the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Ferdinand, the King, and other Princes bounde themſelves, <hi>that the religion comprehended in the Articles of the Auguſtane confeſſion,</hi> should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted free for all men: Sleid. booke 26. This decree was the voice ſaying to the Prophets, that they should goe up into heaven. And not in vaine, but they harkened to the ſame moſt willingly, chaunging with moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mindes their former miſeries for a newe granted dignitie, as is here ſaid, <hi>and they went up into heaven in a cloude.</hi> The enemies ſawe this, &amp; were grieved: eſpecially the Pope, as was meete, tooke it grievouſly, who was thought to ſolicite the Emperour, that he would make voide againe that Edict, Sleid. booke 26.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>And the ſame houre there was a great earthquake:</hi> Aretas. the Complut. Edition, and other read, <hi>and there was in that day.</hi> It is a common thing for an earthquake to ſignify an alteration of things, as wee have obſerved at chap. 6.12. And doubtleſſe a great change followed after this decree, all Europe through. The people of Auſtria require earneſtly of Ferdinand their King, that the ſame should be graunted to them, which was to the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:6819:165"/> confederates of the confeſſion: the ſame the people of Bavaria crave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately of their Prince Albertus. Which Princes when they ſawe, that it was ſcarſe ſafe to be utterly againſt ſo fervent deſire of men, both of them yeeld ſome what to their people, though with an ill will. Like things come to paſſe in many other places: whence one might ſee daylie newe defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Papiſticall Kingdome,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the tenth part of the city fell:</hi> The City in this place is the whole po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piſh Kingdome, which was diminiſhed in a great part of it, when the Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manes forſooke the ſame. I doubt not but the Pope himſelfe will confeſſe willingly, that by this fall he was deprived of a large part of his city: but togither with this ruine <hi>and earthquake</hi> were ſlaine <hi>ſeven thouſand men.</hi> But that which is tranſlated <hi>heads of men,</hi> is in the Greeke, <hi>names of men:</hi> for the men themſelves, as in chap. 3 4. But the kinde of ſpeaking is very ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, teaching that God doth not ſtrike men after the manner of <hi>Blinde Fighters,</hi> but to appointe certenly and by name, whom he will have to be ſlaine by his ſcourges. Theſe ſeven thouſande Papiſts are ſlaine, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being not killed, but they deprived of their great revenues, of Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Collegies, and ſuch yeerly rents without any hope of recoverie. Was it not as death to thoſe idle bellies to be bereaved of their delights, &amp; that men who lately gave their mindes to feede themſelves onely, ſhould be conſtrained nowe to feede others by word, life, or ſome profitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or themſelves to be an hungred? But by the Anguſtane decree, the right of ſuch poſſeſſions was confirmed to the Princes of the Proteſtants: and that afterward without danger the ſame might be beſtowed upon the Miniſtres of the word, Schooles, the poore, and other godly uſes without any feare of extortion. This doubtleſſe was the thing that ſlewe them, that nowe they ſhould be brought to poverty in trueth, who before aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all riot, onely counterfaited the ſame. But to what ende is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſlaine leſſe, then according to the certaine portion of the falling city? For ſeven thouſande onely were killed, but the tenth parth of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty falleth: ſurely becauſe the calamity of the ruine ſhould be greater, then that of the death. For that perteined to the whole multitude of the Popiſh name; the killing was peculiar to the Eccleſiaſticall men, whom this altera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion vexed moſt of all, bringing with it the loſſe of their goods. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people who ſuffered the loſſe onely of their former opinion, bare it more patiently. Therefore whoſe griefe was ſmall, noe death of theirs is mentioned. Howe doeth the Spirit declare unto us theſe events one after an other, and conveniently? He doth all things alone, who before the things come to paſſe, doth tell the condition of them ſo diſtinctly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:6819:166"/> The reſt of the Popiſh religion before, acknowledging the iuſt vengeance of God in the deſtruction and calamity of thoſe Church men, gave glory to the God of Heaven, that is, were converted to the true crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: in whoſe ſtead they worſhipped late Images made of ſome matter, and Idols. And who knoweth not that almoſt an infinite number of men ſtirred up by theſe ſcourges, &amp; opening their eyes to the ſhining light did forſake their former ſuperſtitions? Wee ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the beginning to the ende howe this whole Prophecy agreeth exactly with the event. The ſeven laſt bookes of Sleidans Commentaries, doe afforde a more full declaration both of the battell and death and reſurrection of the Prophets.

Whoſe voices they are, is gathered from that which is ſaid by and by, that <hi>when they were heard, the Elders fell downe upon their faces,</hi> in the next verſe: which they are wont to doe at the <hi>voices of the foure beaſts,</hi> chap. 4.19.20. Therefore they are the <hi>Rulers of the Churches,</hi> who for ſome notable benefit, which the ſound of the ſeven Trumpet brought, doe provoke their flockes to the prayſing of God. They ſhewe what manner of benefit this is, when they ſay, <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes of the world are become our Lords, and his Chriſt &amp;c.</hi> What meaneth this? Doth Chriſt nowe firſt reigne? Surely he ſhall reigne alwayes, even in the middes of his enemies.

               <p>But neither is this any newe thing. He raigned ſo in olde times by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, and other godly Emperours. Alſo in theſe laſt ages, thoſe famous Princes of Germany, had reſtored this Kingdome long ſince. Tho whom may be ioyned Guſtavus King of Suevia, and Chriſtian King of Denne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, who in the yeere a thouſande five hundred thirty eight, changed away the Antichriſtian impiety, for the Ghoſpell. I anſwere that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy meaneth not, that the <hi>Kingdomes</hi> nowe firſt became of the Chriſtian name, but onely that they ſhould be greatly encreaſed, at the ſound of this Trumpet: for then eſpecially wee doe ſay that one doth raigne, when wee ſee the boundes of his Empire enlarged:
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:6819:167"/> albeit it is proper to this time, <hi>that the Kingdome of Chriſt begun from hence, ſhall never againe be darkened, as in the former raignes it came to paſſe, which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time fell into utter decay.</hi> For ſo it is ſaid, <hi>that he ſhall raigne for ever more.</hi> Therefore the firſt entrance of this <hi>Trumpet</hi> ſhould be famous for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of newe Kingdomes: as it came to paſſe in our England, to which Chriſt at <hi>the ſound of the ſeventh trumpet,</hi> in the yeere one thouſand, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fiftieth eight, gave the moſt gratious Queene Elizabeth, who againe gave her Kingdome to Chriſt, in rooting out through all her dominions, the moſt part of the Romiſh ſuperſtitions, and in reſtoring to her people the ſyncere and wholeſome trueth, that wee might worſhip the Lord our God according to his ordinance. King Edward her brother, as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ioſias, performed the ſame thing with an upright heart the whole ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of his raigne, but that his raigne was ſhorte. For the Angell had not yet <hi>ſoundeth the trumpet,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt ſhould raigne for ever.</hi> Therefore the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of perſecution in Queene Maries time ſeemed to caſt downe from the loweſt foundations, that which began notably to be built. After this at length appeaſed, and a faire skie appearing againe, when the comfortable and moſt beautifull ſtarre Elizabeth aroſe, then the Chriſtian Empire was encreaſed, with England and Ireland: the next yeere was Scotland added, that all Britannie with the Ilands might be Chriſts. Howe famous an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe was this to be augmented with ſo great nations? But this glory is greater, becauſe it ſhalbe <hi>eternall.</hi> For ſo the voices ſpeake, <hi>who ſhall raigne for ever.</hi> The former Kingdomes of Chriſt after a ſorte periſhed, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed by the trouble of warres, or chaunged into Antichriſtian bonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge: but after this beginning, Chriſtian Princes ſhall never be wanting who ſhould maintaine the trueth whole &amp; ſound in their dominions.

Wee have Chriſt angry with us, becauſe wee are farre from a perfect reformation: but if wee returne to our vomite, how mightily ſhall he rage againſt us? Therefore they who favour the Papiſts ſecretely, and labour to get liberty for them to pollute the holy Kingdome, by bringing in againe their ceremonies hated of God, they endevour the overthrow of our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and which my hart dreadeth to thinke the death of our moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Queene, For howſoever Chriſt hath begun his eternall Kingdome, yet he hath not bound himſelfe to certaine countries: he shall not want a Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though he shall remove his court to another place, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he may doe at his pleaſure.

But that I may returne to my purpoſe, wee ſee now why thoſe voices reioyced, to with, that the Kingdome of Chriſt was increaſed by the acceſſe of newe people.

After that manner which is foreshewed in this place, where the chiefe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the wholy aſſembly praiſe God in conceived wordes, and the Elders give their conſent, who are in the ſtead of the reſt of the congregation. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, that I may not hide any thing, it came into my minde to merveil why contrary to the manner of other places, as chap. 4.9. and .5.8. and 7.11. and 14.3. and 19.4. in this one onely they are not called <hi>Beaſts</hi> by their owne names. Whither is it becauſe the <hi>Beaſts</hi> are a type, as wee have ſhewed, of ſuch Miniſters as are approved of God: but our doe erre ſo gleatly from Gods ordinance, that the Spirit of purpoſe refuſed to give them the name of <hi>Beaſts?</hi> Surely the things that wee have ſpoken of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicean Church</hi> confirme this doubte. I wiſh that this one thing were not wanting to the reſt of our happineſſe.</p>

               <p n="17">17 <hi>Becauſe thou haſt obtained thy great might:</hi> For all this time, in which Chriſt ſufferred hitherto his Church to be afflicted, he ſeemed to the world to be weake, and of noe ſtrength: nowe he would put on his might, and would manifeſt to all men his ſupreme maieſty over all things.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>And the Gentiles were angry:</hi> This verſe ſetteth before us a ſhort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the whole laſt period, which conſiſteth in three things; <hi>in the wrath of the Gentiles, in the beginning of Gods vengeance, &amp; in the full reward at length of both good and evill.</hi> The wrath of the Gentiles is that rage and furie, wherby they grudge and grinde the teeth tegither, for ſeeing the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt ſo marveilouſly to be increaſed contrary to their deſire. In howe great a fume was the Pope, when liberty to enioy a purer religion was granted to the Germane Princes by a publike decree? But becauſe at <hi>the ſounde of the ſeventh trumpet, the dominion of Chriſt ſhould eſpecially ſhewe it ſelfe,</hi> the chiefe wounding of the whole Popiſh nation was reſerved to this time. Which after they heard of our <hi>England and Queene,</hi> overthrowing the <hi>Romiſh impiety,</hi> burſt out altogither, deviſing for us by what meanes ſoever they could, a finall deſtruction. And many wordes are not needfull in this matter. Known to the whole world are the <hi>Popes</hi> curſes againſt us, our peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple being ſtirred up often to rebellion, the bloody Ieſuites ſent privily daily, hired traitours, privie murtherers, ſorcerers, the Popes armies ſet out in Ireland: the Spaniſh navie, then which there was never any ſtronger and better appointed: Neither yet with weapons and armour more for fight, then with ſcourges, and haltars, and things of that ſort for torment, the deſirous inquiry of Philip the Father (lately wakened almoſt from very death) concerning our England, as though he were to goe by &amp; by into that place, where the teller of our evill ſhould be noe leſſe pleaſant to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then to himſelfe. Rages certenly meete for wicked mindes. For theſe are onely the beginnings of furie although famous &amp; notable: then chiefly the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhall ſtorme, when Chriſt ſhall enter upon his full King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as after more at large. The <hi>Pope and Turke</hi> ſhall purpoſe the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the whole Church: for which cauſe they ſhall gather very great armies. But the rage of men ſhall turne the greater glory of God, as the Pſalmiſt ſingeth. For by how much the danger ſhalbe greater, by ſo much his honour ſhall ſhine the more in delivering his.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond, Gods puniſhement begun, which theſe wordes ſignify: <hi>and his wrath is come,</hi> that conteineth the ſumme of the Vials, which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:6819:168"/> therefore are called <hi>the laſt plagues,</hi> as shall be ſaid in his place.

And ſo is the short ſumme of the things to be declared afterward more plenteouſly.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Then the Temple was opened.</hi> Therefore it was shut before, when it was <hi>meaſured</hi> in the beginning of this chapter, and becauſe the <hi>elect were ſealed.</hi> But now it should be <hi>opened,</hi> noe more to be uſed to the receaving of a fewe faithfull, but that is should extende to an huge multitude of Saincts.

                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:6819:170"/>1 <hi>And a great wonder appeared in heaven:</hi> As touching that wee told in a word in the Analyſis, that the three next chapters togither perteine unto a continuall Hiſtory of the time paſt: peradventure it may ſeeme ſtrange to ſome body, why the Spirit should doe that which is already done, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hearſe againe the former Hiſtory, ſet forth ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly as it ſeemeth, in thoſe thinges that have bin ſaid before: eſpecially in this place after the <hi>blowing of the ſeventh trumpet,</hi> when <hi>ſhortly there ſhould be an ende of all thinges,</hi> as wee have learned from the tenth chapter. There are moſt iuſt cauſes of both: for no man beholding ſeparated and diſperſed partes here and there of a building, ſcarce comprehendeth in minde any fashion of the whole frame, much leſſe perceiveth he the handſomneſſe, which would be of them ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togither, every one ſet in his owne place, and couched togither in fit order. The former handling was a certen preparation of devided partes: but this continuall narration doth properly ioyne all things togither in one, and ſetteth before our eyes the whole frame, that wee may ſee to what ſumme at length that ſingular building commeth. But it is reſerved to this time, becauſe before <hi>the laſt Trumpet,</hi> there could not be a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending of theſe thinges. The events came forth by peecemeale &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly: the knowledge whereof the world received a part and by little and little, after the manner of folded tapeſtry: but all things at length being ended, nowe there was time to behold the whole unfolded cloath, and of appropriating togither the univerſall building. But chiefly by this rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall wee are taught, that ſuch an Hiſtory of all thoſe thinges under the laſt trumpet is to be made, as is inſtituted typically in theſe three chapters. Which thing came to paſſe about the yeere one thouſand five hundreth &amp; threeſcore, certaine learned and skilfull men framing that excellent worke of the <hi>Centuries</hi> at Maidenburge. In which thirteene Centuries, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the birth of Chriſt unto the yeere one thouſand three hundreth is founde here and there among the auncient Churches, or politique wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is brought into one body, and as a built houſe all things fitly ioyned togither, is placed to be ſeene at once. From which our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey man Iohn Foxe, and Iohn Sleidan receaved a great light, who continued the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the yeere 1555. that is to ſay, unto that time which by two or three yeeres went before <hi>the blowing of the ſeventh Trumpet.</hi> For this cauſe, to wit by the force of the reſtored Church, and of that commandement in chap. 10.10.11. the former times are repeated under <hi>the laſt trumpet,</hi> becauſe nowe at length all thinges ſhould be declared moſt copiouſly by the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the learned which had come to paſſe never before. The like indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie of learned men about the ende of <hi>the ſixt trumpet</hi> brought foorth that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:6819:170"/> continuall narration, whereof wee ſpake in the former chapter: but that was more generall, and obſcure in conſideration of that time: but this moſt full and aboundant, obtained by a greater knowledge of things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ever before this time. Theſe thinges are to be obſerved touching the order of the Prophecy, to the ende that wee may ſee the more eaſily, not as ſome ſuppoſe, theſe things to be ſet in an other place, but moſt wiſely and fitly to be reſerved unto <hi>the laſt Trumpet,</hi> as to their naturall and moſt proper place.</p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſſe there is noe cauſe why in this repetition wee should fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re a twice ſodden Colewort. For wee shall nowe beholde that face of things ioyned togither by their ioints, of which before time there could be noe looking upon. Therefore, as touching <hi>this great wonder,</hi> it is ſeene in heaven, a type of the true and heavenly Church, whoſe condition he fet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched from the beginning, to wit, from the beginning of the ſeales, &amp; the time of the Revelation given, containing in the ſixe firſt verſes, what was her ſtate from thence to Conſtantine the Great, in whom <hi>the ſixt Seale</hi> alſo ended, as wee shewed at the ſixt chapter. And it is manifeſt that the ſame ſpace of time is reckened up, by the deſcription of <hi>the woman</hi> &amp; <hi>the Dragon,</hi> with the event <hi>of the perſecution,</hi> and of that <hi>open warre,</hi> which is made with <hi>Michaell,</hi> as shalbe shewed in their places. The woman which is ſeene doth rightly beare the image of the Church, which ſo often times in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is called <hi>the Spouſe. The cloathing of the Sunne,</hi> is the excellent bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and purity of that time, as touching the doctrine of luſtification, and the ſyncerity of the whole faith: for the garment, as wee have shewed in other place, is the imputed righteouſnes of Chriſt. <hi>The Sunne</hi> noteth the light of the Scriptures. Therefore <hi>the cloathing of the Sunne,</hi> is ſuch a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the righteouſnes of Chriſt alone, as the ſcriptures teach. Which is a moſt comely ornament of the firſt Church, which the opinion of our ſtrength had noe whit yet darkened.</p>
               <p>In other places of the Scriptures this <hi>cloathing is of white and pure linen.</hi> But the glory of any later time doe not attaine unto this moſt excellent glory of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The MOONE under her feete:</hi> This is commonly and ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto the deſpiſed and troden under foote vanity of worldly things, which are as variable and changeable as the MOONE. In which reſpect the <hi>Woman</hi> hath noe greater regard of ſuch earthly things, then of that which commonly men doe trample and treade upon with the ſoles of their feete.</p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:6819:171"/>
               <p>But from the former things wee have learned, that the <hi>Moone</hi> doth ſignify the light of truth and doctrine borrowed from the Scriptures, which now being put under her feete, may shewe that all the ſteppes of this Church are directed and diſpoſed according to the onely rule of the one of theſe. For it is not inough to shine rounde about with the <hi>Sunne,</hi> unleſſe the ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes be ſet in the way of Godlines. As therefore the <hi>cloathing of the Sunne</hi> is the doctrine of faith, ſo <hi>the Moone under the feete</hi> is the doctrine of manners: which are either publike or private. They comprehende the whole manner of worshipping God, and revoking of thoſe that erre, which is called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline</hi> commonly. Theſe private are ſeen in the common life of every one. Great was the glory then <hi>of the woman,</hi> before whom the heavenly light of trueth went in all thinges, whether publikely or privately. I take rather this latter applying, becauſe it is more fit to abide in the ſignification once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: albeit I would not have utterly reiected the former interpretation, as being godly and learned. <hi>The crowne of twelve ſtarres on the head</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the shining adminiſters of the doctrine, <hi>the twelve Apoſtles,</hi> by whoſe preaching the Church was founded, and alſo <hi>the Apoſtolicall men,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the word from them that ſawe the things don their ſelves, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Church chaſt and undefiled. But it is to be obſerved that the <hi>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> doth carry the <hi>ſtarres</hi> in an other manner then <hi>Chriſt:</hi> hee being Lord of all carried them as it were ſervants in his hande, chap. 2.16. ſhee beareth them as her chiefe ornament on <hi>the crowne of her head.</hi> Such then is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explication. Which deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, howe well it agreeth to that church, noe man can be ignorant of, who hath ben even but meanly acquainted with the Hiſtory. She was moſt glorious by the cloathing of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith, in retayning faithfully the doctrine which shee had received from Chriſt, the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and other Apoſtolike men. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was shee yet defyled with the uncleaneſſe of humane invention, but in the whole worship, diſcipline, life, manners, shee had the <hi>Moone</hi> under her feete, following the ſacred trueth as her North-ſtarre: in all thinges there was one forme of governing in all Churches, the very ſame which is taught in the <hi>Actes of the Apoſtles,</hi> and their other writings. Or if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will referre the <hi>Moone to the vanity of wordly things,</hi> how free was shee from ambition, and deſire of honours? How greatly did shee abhorre the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of riches, and contention for dignity? How ſyncere is the Hiſtory of that time in Euſebius? The Bishops are reckened by name, excellent for their manners and doctrine: their conflicts, labours, and ſufferings are declared; but as yet the proude names of honours and dignities were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the world: <hi>the burning mountaine was not yet caſt into the Sea:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

But to what ende should she have Gold on her head, under whoſe feete did lie whatſoever is pretious in this world? The glory therefore hereof is the integrity of the Miniſters, noe mortall dignity.

Which thing she knew that she should obtaine, if ſometime at length shee could bring forth one who should rule the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth, and have the chiefe menaging of things. For the <hi>woman</hi> was not barren before this time, but happie for iſſue in very great number: but one ſonne was yet wanting, who might be able to defende her from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of the enemies: whom while shee is in labour with, and prepareth a defender, shee ſufferred moſt sharpe paines, before she could obtaine that which she deſired.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And another wonder appeareth.</hi> So is the deſcription of the <hi>woman,</hi> the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:6819:172"/> reſt of her condition is made apparant from the deſcription of the enemy, to wit the <hi>Dragon:</hi> both from the things <hi>inherent,</hi> in this verſe, and alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>effects</hi> in the verſe following. Thoſe firſt are his <hi>red colour, hornes, heads, crownes:</hi> before all which is ſet the place in which the <hi>Dragon</hi> appeared, to wit, <hi>in heaven,</hi> not ſo called properly, (for what hath the <hi>Dragon,</hi> that is, <hi>the Devill,</hi> to doe in the heavenly pallace, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he is banished for ever?) but in the heaven which is in earth. But this Dragon is not onely the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> in his owne proper perſon, but alſo men being the Miniſters of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, eſpecially the Romane Emperours, whom from that time in which Iohn wrote, perſecuted moſt grievouſly Chriſt in his members, as <hi>Traiane, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Verus, Commodus, Severus, Decius,</hi> and at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth <hi>Diocletianus,</hi> open enemies, who make a profeſſed warre, are called in this booke <hi>Dragons,</hi> of which ſort is at this day the <hi>Turke.</hi> Others, who in name are Chriſtians, but fight againſt the truth ſecretly, and by indirect ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are called <hi>Beaſts,</hi> which doe prey upon men onely for to ſatiſfy their hunger: whereas the Dragons forced by noe want of meat, are carried to our deſtruction becauſe of that hatred which is betweene man kinde and them. This <hi>Dragon</hi> was once in heaven, as long as the open enemies held the Empire of the world, exerciſing dominion over men named Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which wer diſperſed through all places of their Empire. He is called <hi>Great,</hi> being the higheſt Prince on earth: and <hi>red</hi> being moſt furious againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtians, wholly red with their blood. <hi>The ſeaven heads</hi> are ſeaven hilles, and ſeaven Kinges, after chap. 17.9.10. unto which place wee deferre the more full handling of theſe thinges. In the meane time, for this matter which is in hand, it shalbe ſufficient to underſtand, that by this circunſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of wordes, the city is noted, where he should place the ſeate of the Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to wit, <hi>Rome,</hi> famous for the ſeaven hilles and Kings.

Therefore if her ſeat shalbe at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo shalbe his. <hi>The tenne hornes</hi> are ſo many Kinges, or Provinces go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned of Pretors like to Kings. So Strabo declareth it in the laſt wordes of his laſt booke of Geographic: <hi>That Auguſtus Ceſar devided the whole Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire into two partes: the troublous and warlike Provinces of which he tooke to himſelfe, the other peaceable and quiet ones he gave to the people. Who devided theirs in ten Pretories, the exterior Spaine and her Ilands: The interiour containing Baetica, now called Granata, and the countrey of Narbon in France even unto Alen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cem Sardinia, with Corſica: Sicilia: Illyricum, Epyrus being adioyned. Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Achaia even unto Theſſalia: Aetolia and Acarninia, and certaine nations of Epirus to the borders of Macedonia, Creta, with Cyrenaica: Cyprus: Bithynia with Propontide, and certaine parts of Pontus.</hi> Suetonius alſo maketh mention of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:6819:172"/> the like diſpoſing of the Provinces, but telleth not the number; to Aug. in chap. 47. Moreover the ſame Strabo reporteth that <hi>Dicharchies doe and alwaies have belonged to the Emperours portion. For Ceſar held the reſt diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed alſo in tenne Prouinces:</hi> to wit, <hi>Afrike, France, Britannie; Germany: Dacie, Myſie, Thracie, Cappadocie, Armenie: Syrie, Paleſtine, Judea, and Aegypte.</hi> And this is the ſame thing which Cyprian writeth to Succeſſus: <hi>that Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus wrote an anſwer to the Senate, that all belonging to the Emperour, whoſo ever had confeſſed before, or ſhall now confeſſe, ſhould be ſeiſed upon, and bound, ſhoulb be ſent enrolled into the Emperours poſſeſſions,</hi> that is, into thoſe farre countries which wee ſpake of, belonging to the Romane Empire. Therefore whither wee reſpect <hi>the countryes</hi> which the Emperour held in his owne poſſeſsion, or thoſe which he yeelded to the people, they were <hi>the tenne hornes,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er and ſtrength of the Dragon, in which all his might conſiſted. Yet the number remained alwaies the ſame, but was altered according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion. But it was ſufficient for the Spirit to deſcribe the enemy by any certen marke, then which there is none more cleare, then the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this dominion, and this ſo notable a decree of the Provinces devi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded. <hi>But he beareth the crownes on his heads,</hi> not on his hornes, becauſe the ſupreme maieſty did abide at Rome, to which all the reſt of the Provinces ſubmitted their dignities.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Whoſe taile drewe:</hi> Conſidering that the <hi>Dragon</hi> is of ſuch a diſpoſition, how doth he carry himſelfe towards the Church?

                  <hi>¶ But the Dragon ſtood before the woman:</hi> He watched her diligently that noe maintainer of the Chriſtian religion should be borne. He rolled every ſtone for to cut of this hope. Add certenly aſſoone as <hi>Maximinus</hi> the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon ſawe Alexander of Mammea to be ſomewhat favourable to Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſo as he was thought to have ben inſtructed in their ordinances, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with devoured him. <hi>Decius</hi> alſo the <hi>Dragon</hi> did ſwalowe downe the <hi>Philips,</hi> both the Father and the Sonne: he himſelfe shortly after being ſwalowed up in a marſh. But the thing is made manifeſt moſt clearely in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantine. at whome chiefly the Spirit pointed the finger. <hi>Diocletianus</hi> &amp; <hi>Galerius</hi> with whom hee lived being a yong man in the Eaſt, perceaving his ſingular towardnes and vertue, left nothing untried, that they might kill him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily. So Euſebius writeth upon his life, in his firſt booke. Pomponius Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:6819:173"/> reporteth that he was ſent with an army againſt the people of Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, moſt fierce nations, and accuſtomed to murders: from whom, when contrary to the opinion of Galerius, he brought backe not death but the victory, by the perſuaſion of the ſame man, under a colour of exerciſing his valour, he fought on the Theatre with a Lion. For Galerius ſought, to deſtroy the unwarie yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man, as of olde Euriſtheus did Hercules. Neither was ther here an ende of the treacheries. Maximian Herculius that <hi>red Dra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gon,</hi> devoured him almoſt afterward by ſnares ſet to intrappe him. But he which laide a ſnare for an other, through the iuſt iudgement of God, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished himſelfe in the ſnare. Conſtantine eſcaped many other privie aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, not by humane wiſdome, but by divine revelation from God, as Eu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſebius writeth upon Conſtantines life, in his firſt booke. For the Dragon knewe that it concerned him much, that no ſuch a one ſhould ariſe: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is no marveile if he did labour ſo greatly, to devoure this childe aſſonne as it ſhould be borne.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And ſhee brought forth a male childe;</hi> The event of the perſecution: at length the Church howſoever the Dragon ſtrove againſt her with all his might, bringeth forth a male and ſtrong defender, by inſtructing Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tine the Great in the Chriſtian faith. For he <hi>was that male childe,</hi> who firſt of all the Romane Emperours, tooke upon him the defence of the trueth. Wee have made mention of the <hi>Philippes both Father and Sonne,</hi> which were both Chriſtians.

This is certaine that they little or nothing helped the ſtate of Chriſtians. The male childe was not borne before Conſtantine. He was the firſt of all that delivered the Church vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly from the tyranny of the enemies, he maintained and defended the ſame ſtrongly, increaſed and enlarged it wonderfully, he brought the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſo greatly longed for, eſtablished it for ever.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:6819:173"/> moſt famous victories among all men, and made him to be feared of all adverſaries:</hi> In the firſt orat. upon the life of Conſtantine. Whereupon the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours almoſt of all nations ranne togither to his Court continually, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the diſtance of place let either the Indians or Aethiopians, <hi>which two wayes are divided the fardeſt of all men:</hi> as the ſame Euſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bius writeth out of Homer, that they should not bring their gifts to get his favour. For he ruled with a rod of yron, who ſo repreſſed all enemies with force and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that no man durſt even to lift up his finger againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And her ſonne was taken up unto God:</hi> How taken up? whether by death wherby Conſtantine being taken from the earth, was received up into hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven? Or rather by a great earthly dignity, which God beſtowed on him, being delivered from the lying in waite of adverſaries, and conſpiracie of enemies. The thing it ſelfe ſeemeth rather to approve this latter: eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeing <hi>the Magiſtrates are called Gods;</hi> by which proportion <hi>the Throne of ſupreme dignity,</hi> is called rightly <hi>the Throne of God himſelfe.</hi> Alſo in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter <hi>the two Prophets</hi> reviving, <hi>and recovering their former honour, are ſaid to goe up into heaven,</hi> ver. 12. Neither is it like to be true, that he whoſe power should be ſo great over the nations, should have his birth &amp; death ioyned togither, not any notable great acte being mentionned, that hee might give ſome shewe of his received power. Therefore to be taken up un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God in this place, is to be placed in the higheſt toppe of dignity amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, That is to ſay, be made an Emperour. But he is ſaide to be <hi>taken up,</hi> becauſe the Empire was not ſo much ſought of him, as given to him thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no ſuch thing. He had eſcaped the conſpiracies by flying to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom he found dying aſſoone as he came. Who at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth being dead, he tooke all that power by inheritance, under the shadow whereof he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be covered whiles his father lived. Shortly after he is deſired with earneſt requeſts of the people of Rome, whom the great tyranny of Maxe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius oppreſſed, they exhorte and beſeech him that he would not lurke in a certaine corner of the earth, but would take upon him the governement of the whole world being offered unto him. There was added a heavenly token, and a voice commanding him to doubt nothing of the victory. How great was this force from God, taking up a man to ſo great dignity? Vndoubtedly hee could gladly have ben at reſt in his fathers bounds of Fraunce and Britanny, in which he kept himſelfe quiet the five firſt yeeres, unleſſe he had ben taken up perforce of God in heaven, to a greater Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire then that which he had purpoſed in his minde.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>But the woman fled:</hi> The other event is in reſpect <hi>of the woman,</hi> who by and by after the birth of her male childe fled away. Which flight is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:6819:174"/> from <hi>the place</hi> whither shee went, from <hi>the condition</hi> wherein shee was in that place, &amp; <hi>the ſpace of time</hi> which shee remained there. All which things are declared ſomewhat more largely afterward, from verſ 13. where a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuall Prophecy of her is made: here they are mentioned in fewe words, as in their proper place, to the ende that wee may the more eaſilie under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to what time this flight properly pertaine. The place is the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that is, <hi>the Temple meaſured of God,</hi> chap. 11.1. where a fewe elect ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hid, was a mere wilderneſſe, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of that great aſſembly which poſſeſſed the <hi>holy city and the uttermoſt court.</hi> Yet this wilderneſſe is a place prepared for her of God, as wee have ſeen from ſo exact a meaſuring of the Temple. For God had a care of her and provided for her a cover to hide in, howſoever hee ſuffered her to want a publike aſſemblie. <hi>The condition of her lying hid</hi> is ſuch, that shee should be nourished by the meanes of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten men: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> whereof wee have heard in the former chapter, ver. 3. <hi>power given them to prophecy,</hi> was the miniſtery of nourriſhing the woman. For as God <hi>raining Manna from heaven,</hi> fed the Iſraelites once in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo he prepared meate in the wilderneſſe for the woman. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more he would rather have committed the office of feedind to the ravens, as we ſee that he did to Elaja, then that he would have ſufferred her to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish through famine. This is therefore that time, when they that overcame did eate of the hidden Manna, as we have ſaid in the Church of Pergamus, chap. 2.17. The <hi>ſpace</hi> wherin she should be darkely known in the publike is <hi>a thouſand two hundreth and threeſcore dayes,</hi> the ſame that thoſe two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes prophecied clothed in ſakecloth, chap. 11.23. The concurring of all which things teacheth, that this <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> is that <hi>temple,</hi> and that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iourning in banishement in the wilderneſſe, is that <hi>dwelling in the ſanctuary.</hi> Whence it is, that the ſame beginning is to be attributed to both, to wit, <hi>the ſixt Seale,</hi> as we have shewed more at large in chap. 11.2. Vpon which time did fall that <hi>ſealing</hi> in chap. 7. All which doe moſt ſtrongly confirme, that our interpretation, which wee have hitherto given. But why fled the woman being increaſed with ſo mighty a ſonne, who before being ſuccour leſſe, and labouring with great paine to bring forth, did withſtande ſo ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the rage of the Dragon? Certainely the feare of the enemie did not put her to flight, but the lothing of ſome domeſticall evill.</p>
               <p>And ſo indeede it came to paſſe, that the ſecurity that ſuch a ſonne was borne, tooke away all regard of true godlines. For now the tyrants being driven from their neckes, they were at good leiſure to follow after conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ambition. Now there was leiſure to ſearch dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the reliques
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:6819:174"/> of the ſaincts, to conſecrate Temples to Martyrs, and to pray in all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. No outward griefes did hinder, but that men might freely give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the corrupting of all religion. Therefore that ſimple integritie, which Chriſt appointed, the Apoſtles practiſed, and which was alſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, by their next ſucceſſours, whiles the croſſe ſuffered not their mindes to be wanton; began wholly to be defiled and violated with idle &amp; impure ceremonies mixed with it. The <hi>cloathing of the Sune,</hi> which was whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in the warpe ſo alſo in the wourfe, of the threedes of the ſacred verity, began to be altered by the holines of our workes. The <hi>Moone</hi> which governed their pathes, was driven out of her place by the invocation of Saincts in the publike worshipe, and by the violating of the whole ſacred diſcipline. The <hi>ſhining ſtarres</hi> in the crowne of her head, were changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honourable Lords. Which the <hi>woman</hi> ſeing, endured not the griefe, but by and by getting her ſelfe away, fled thither, where at leaſt shee might be freed from the torment of ſeing, that is to ſay, no publike aſſemblies were found, wherein Gods ordinances did floriſh entire and whole. For the faithfull one by one are not the woman, but the whole congregations of the faithfull. So <hi>the Sonne</hi> brought more hurt then the enemie: not of a will to hurt, but by the wickedneſſe of men, which abuſed ſhamefully ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a peace to all impiety.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>And there was a battell in heaven:</hi> Hitherto of the perſequution, whiles no man through all this ſpace of the Seales, did withſtand the rage of the <hi>Dragon:</hi> now at length warre is made <hi>Michaell</hi> being riſen, who ſhould take up armes for the defenſe of the Church, and delivered her from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the enemies. But as touching <hi>Michaell,</hi> this name it may be belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth properly to Chriſt alone: which yet is communicated to the faithfull, in as much as they are able by the ſtrength of his ſpirit to carie ſome image of this name, even as <hi>he giveth to them that overcome his power to rule the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with a rod of yron.</hi> For the chiefe Captaines doe not make this battell with their armies on both ſides, in heaven it ſelfe properly ſo called (for howe can the Devill appeare in heaven, which was throwen downe from thence at the beginning, never to returne thither afterward.) But this battell is made in the Church upon the earth, in which ſenſe the <hi>Dragon was ſeen in heaven,</hi> above in ver. 3. In this wraſſeling both the Princes doe exerciſe their ſtrength by miniſters, who are noted by their names. Therefore <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell</hi> by communication of name is <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the faithfull ſouldier of Chriſt, who even now was called <hi>the man childe.</hi> But the <hi>Dragon</hi> is <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Maximinus, Licinius,</hi> by whoſe tyranny the Devill powred forth his hatred againſt the Church. The <hi>Angels</hi> are the armies warring under the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:6819:175"/> banners of both the Captaines. Wee have shewed before in the 6. chap. ver. 15. that Chriſt began the warre againſt the Dragon, when he did caſt downe from the high Empire Diocletian and Maximin Hercule, by a ſhew of a voluntary giving over, and drove Galerius to a recantation by an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torment of diſeaſes. But then Chriſt fought by his owne ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, bringing a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull helpe from heaven: but in this warre wherein a lawfull victory was to be gotten, &amp; the <hi>Dragon</hi> to be throwen altogither from heaven, it ſeemed good to him to uſe the labour of his <hi>Servant.</hi> This therefore is that warre, which firſt Conſtantine tooke upon him againſt Maxentius the Sonne of Maximinus Herculeus. Afterward which he made againſt Maximinus in the Eaſt by Licinius: &amp; laſtly which he made againſt Licinius himſelfe, endevouring the ſame things, which the other tyrants did. For that wee may underſtand under whoſe conduct theſe warred, Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantine miraculouſly is appointed the Emperour of the holy warre. <hi>For behold the heavenly ſigne of a moſt bright croſſe, which he ſawe in heaven about mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>day: by this doe thou overcome;</hi> the meaning of which, a viſion in the night when he was at reſt, opened more fully. Wherby it was plainely teſtifyed that he was not made Governour over this expedition, ſo much by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the people, as by the voice of God himſelfe. For I like not to take away the credit of the miracle: Conſtantine himſelfe confirmed the thing by an oth to Euſebius. Although there is no matter of weight from hence to eſtabliſh the Romish Idolatry: for the impiety <hi>of worſhipping the Croſſe</hi> was not yet knowne: neither was this ſigne given to that ende, that it should be worshipped religiouſly, or that it should be any religious thing: but onely as a token of the faith, and a certaine pledge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wherby Conſtantine yet a yong Chriſtian, might goe forward more cheerefully, and fight with greater hope againſt the enemies of the death of Chriſt. But the craftines of the Devill, &amp; the corruption of mans minde, turned this ſigne given, not long after, into deſtruction, as of olde alſo the <hi>Braſen Serpent</hi> commanded by God. Maxentius contrariwiſe made warre under the conduct and power of the Devill onely, <hi>he being a moſt wretched worſhipper and conſulter of Devils, ripping women great with childe, that he might looke into the bowels of the children not yet brought forth Maximinus</hi> &amp; <hi>Licinius</hi> were Princes of the ſame impiety, ſo as there is no man, but beholding theſe Captaines ſet in the place of them that were dead, may eaſily ſee Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell to ſtand on the one ſide, and the Devill on the other.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>But they prevailed not:</hi> The event of the warre; the happines of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, did now forſake the enemies. Before they trode under foot the Church at their pleaſure: now fighting <hi>with her man childe</hi> they are ſlaine
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:6819:175"/> with a finall deſtruction. Maxentiꝰ <hi>the Dragon</hi> was drowned in the river of Tiber. Maximinus prevented a baniſhement by Licinius through a ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death: Licinius himſelfe more then once or twiſe being put to flight in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten battels, was at length beheaded. So <hi>the Dragon</hi> was now utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and driven out of heaven, where lately he held a place by tyrannie. For their place was found no more in heaven, the open enemies being ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dued and deſtroyed, much more removed from the government of the common wealth, without any hope to recover it afterward. For from this time the Devill was bound for a thouſand yeeres, as in chap. 20.2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then being looſed ſhall he have rule over the Chriſtians, but the hurts which he shall doe, shalbe onely the bitings of the heele: in the meane while that it should be manifeſt to all men, that now the Dragon was whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly conquered and throwen downe from heaven, God governing every thing by his eternall providence, would that a token should be ſet up ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Devill being bereſt of power to hurt the Saincts, did nowe vexe theſe with all manner of ſtormes, as we have read that it came to paſſe in the Eaſt under Conſtantine, Conſtantius, Valens, Iulianus and the reſt. In part wee have already shewed before what ſturres the Devill made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the BISHOPS. But it belongeth not to my purpoſe to proſecute the thing more at large.

Neither doe I doubt, but whoſoever ſhall reade their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will freely confeſſe, <hi>theſe men to have ben moved by the furies of hell:</hi> they troubled and confounded all things with ſo mad affection.

Envy rather delighteth to poure out her poiſon upon the Saincts, then for noe neceſsity to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, who are already inough ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and made ſubiect to him: he would ſpare this labour gladly, and would make triall of it rather in them, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is grieved to have be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pulled
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6819:177"/> out of his iawes. Furthermore the word <hi>knowing,</hi> may be an argument to prove this thing, the future moments of times, are without doubt hidden from the Devill. Eſpecially the laſt day of all, which alſo the Sonne knewe not. But he could not but knowe his preſent <hi>oportunitie.</hi> This therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be the cauſe of his fury, that being <hi>caſt out of heaven,</hi> now he muſt needes bring forth his rage againſt his owne citizens: when he deſired ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hurt the elect: whom he could not touch, being driven out from their company: which large field of his furie being taken from him, he thought that which remained to be but ſmall.</p>

Surely from hence, becauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours chiefe care was to expell the open enemies, which thing at length having attained, they cared not much for other things: neither conſidered they, at leaſt ſo diligently as was meete, that the <hi>Dragon</hi> had many other wayes to hurt; which they unawares made more eaſy by their meanes, ſo farre of was it that they ſet themſelves valiantly againſt his enterpriſes. From hence therefore <hi>the Dragon</hi> firſt ſowed privie bitternes of mindes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Biſhops, which having ſprung up togither with Conſtantine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the trumpets began to ſounde, cauſed a ſorowfull perceiving of the future trouble, as we have noted at the eight chapter, ver. 2.

But the rage of perſecution waxed moſt fierce, when <hi>Conſtance, Julian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Valens</hi> exerciſed tyranny againſt the Orthodoxe in an hoſtile manner. Certes <hi>Conſtance</hi> &amp; <hi>Valens</hi> differreth nothing from the moſt cruell tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, except in name onely. They were counted Chriſtian Princes, but under that name they carryed the cruelty af the Ethnicks. Therefore the <hi>Dragon</hi> graunted noe truce, but being expelled from heaven, vexed the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:6819:178"/> woman foorthwith by other meanes. This perſecution is that which wee ſpake of in the expoſition of the <hi>firſt, ſecond,</hi> &amp; <hi>third trumpet,</hi> in chap. 8. But ſee how profitable this repetition is, which giveth knowledge of an other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyned cauſe of thoſe tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets. There we learned that they in the iuſt iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement of God, were inflicted upon the world, becauſe it embraced not the truth with that faith, holines, and love that was meete: and therefore the coales of the altar thrown into the earth raiſed up that burning flame: from hence wee are taught what was <hi>the inſtrument,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Dragon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who did caſt men headlong into that madnes, that by their meanes hee might ſcourge the woman.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>But to the woman were given two wings:</hi> The avoiding of the aſſault which the <hi>Dragon</hi> made, beſides which none other was left, namely, to provide for her ſafety by flight, as ſoone as poſsible can be, to withdrawe her ſelfe from theſe ſturres. Whiles therefore the aſſemblyes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are filled with ſuperſtitions, the Bishops hate and contende one with another. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> &amp; <hi>Valens</hi> ſhew rigour by fire and ſword. The auncient verity flyeth wholly away (for lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſince ſhe had prepared her flight in ſome part,) neither is the true face of a Church ſeen any where. For ſwiftnes of flight are given <hi>two wings,</hi> yea that more is, <hi>of that great Eagle</hi> God once de parting from the temple, went away leyſurely &amp; by little and little, Ezech. 9.3. But the woman a little before delaying, goeth not away ſlowly &amp; at leiſure at this time: but vaniſhed away as it were at one moment. Yet ſhee fled not becauſe ſhee feared the cruelty eyther <hi>of Conſtantius</hi> or <hi>Valens,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other mans, (for ſhee had learned long ſince to contemne both ſword, and fire, and alſo racke, or any other moſt exquiſite torments): but when ſhee had ſeen <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be propugned under the prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the <hi>name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and not onely the bodies to be killed, but ſoules alſo to be caryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction, ſhee thought that this was to be ſufferred by noe meanes. Shee flyeth away therefore for hatred of this indignity, whom noe other dangers made afraid. For shee is wont to dread hereſie more then torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and to tremble more at wicked and obſtinate errours, then at bloody diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrings in peeces. Shee knoweth that the blood <hi>of the Martyrs is the ſeed of her fielde,</hi> and that every droppe of blood ſo shed, doth beget many other Chriſtians: but that abſurde opinions doe, as the ſowing of ſalt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke her land barren; partly by killing that which flourished, partly in letting that nothing may growe.

For while they gave their names even to this religion, and ſuffer themſelves to be enrolled citizens of the ſame, they were not ſo ſpite full againſt the Chriſtian nation, that they would purpoſe to roote it out.

Therefore firſt, he mooved the Saracens to fall away from the Romaines; Secondly he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Mahumet</hi> their Captaine: then he ſent him into the whole world to deſtroy all. Who can declare the Iliad of miſeries, which flowed from thence? From that time there was continuall warre, for a whole ſeven hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Perſia even to the furthermoſt Iles of Gades, and almoſt from Lybia into Fraunce.

Surely the Chriſtian world was very greatly afflicted her by. For the Devill ſpared not his owne, ſo that he might deſtroy <hi>that lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſeed</hi> in the common calamity. This warre was shewed before, partly by the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> as wee have expounded in ch. 9: partly by the <hi>Euphratean Angels,</hi> that is, the Turkes, who in theſe dayes accomplished that which the Saracens had begunne. Neither ought it to ſeeme a ſtrange thing, that ſo cruell a name is now given to the thing which long agoe was an armie of ſmall vermine: other is the outward face of a thing already accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſuch as is mentioned in this place: and other of a thing in hand yet to be finished, of which ſorte it is there. Nowe therefore wee may ſee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perſecution in the Eaſt, the overflowing of the barbarous people in the Weſt, and the warre of the Saracens common to both, by which miſeries the Dragon troubled the world, after that he had loſt heaven, and howe iuſt cauſe there was to denounce a <hi>woe to the inhabitans of the earth,</hi> as wee have heard at the ſeventeenth verſe.</p>
               <p>And this whole Chapter may be in ſtead of a Commentarie, shewing howe that the <hi>Prince that ruleth in the aire, is the Spirit that worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> as wee have it in the Epiſtle of Paul to the Epheſians, chapter ſecond and ſecond verſe. Such then is the Hiſtory of the Dragon,

The other of fraude and craftines hee giveth to his Vicar the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of the which enemy wee shall ſpeake in the Chapter nex following. The whole Prophecy is more or leſſe, of a thouſande two hundred yeeres from Iohn the Apoſtle, unto the yeere 1300. Where alſo the Centuries doe ende, being ſet forth under this laſt trumpet, of which wee ſaid that this repetition is a type.</p>

For he attributeth it to the Devill, who even now went his way to make warre with the reſt of the Saincts, and for madnes was not able to ſtand ſtill in any place.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any other intent of ſtanding on the ſande, then that the riſing up of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> might be ſeen, which concerneth nothing the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Therefore the wordes are to be referred unto Iohn, in which there is a tranſition unto the enemy, ſet in the place of him that is dead: to the contemplating of whoſe originall Iohn ſaith that he was ſet in a moſt convenient place. In which he declareth that it doth appertaine to them onely to beholde the Beaſt riſing up, who after they have eſcaped the Sea of falſe doctrine, are ſet at leaſt on the shore or banke of the truth, howſoever it may be, that the mooving of the waves, and the ebbing of the Sea caſteth upon them alſo many brinish errours becauſe of nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: as after <hi>they that doe get victory of the BEAST, are ſaid to ſtand at the GLASSIE SEA</hi> as wee may ſee in the fifteenth Chapter and ſecond verſe.</p>
               <p>For that theſe things doe pertaine and are to be refferred to the event, may be gathered from the like place in the ſeventeenth Chapter and at the third verſe: where <hi>IOHN is carried into the Wilderneſſe for to beholde the damnation of the WHORE.</hi> For what need were there to change the place, unleſſe the remooving had a Myſtery? Here therefore ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are to be viewed, to whom, being ſet as it were on the shore of the Trueth, the originall of the <hi>SEA BEAST</hi> should be certenly knowne: and that alſo at that time, in which the Devill went for to make warre againſt the ſeed of the woman. For neither is this place attributed raſhly to this tranſition.</p>

Which doubtleſſe many learned men alſo before painted out in lively colours, but all their labour was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about one or two parts, none made a perfit image before the ſeventh trumpet, which procured us theſe Centuries.

               <p>THVS farre hath ben the battell with the <hi>Dragon;</hi> the combate with the <hi>Beaſt</hi> followeth; which is double: the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the firſt is from the beginning of the chapter to the 11. verſe.

Furthermore from his authority, wherby he doth excell, which is threefolde, at the firſt <hi>received from the Dragon;</hi> a while after <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;</hi> afterward <hi>recovered</hi> againe his wonde being healed: which is more amplifyed then that firſt, as declare, both <hi>the honour which the worſhippers give to him,</hi> ver. 4. &amp; <hi>the power both to blaſpheme and alſo to make warre,</hi> ver. 5.6.7.

                  <hi>¶ Then I ſaw a Beaſt:</hi> That the whole next treatiſe may be more cleare, two thinges briefly are to be conſidered, before wee come to the unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of every ſeverall thing. The firſt is the <hi>kinde</hi> of this Beaſt, the other of <hi>the time</hi> wherein he ariſeth. As touching <hi>that firſt, this Beaſt is not the civile Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire:</hi> either Heatheniſh, or Chriſtian, corrupt with hereſy. For if wee regard the Heathen Emperours, they reigned when Iohn wrote: but <hi>this Beaſt was not yet come,</hi> whoſe firſt beginning he ſawe in a type. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whoſe originall he had repreſented unto him, was paſt but to come, according to that ſaying, <hi>J will ſhewe thee the things which muſt be done hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> chap. 4.1. But the Angel afterward affirmeth playnely, that he was not yet come, ſaying <hi>five are fallen, one is, and an other is not yet come,</hi> chap. 17.10. It is manifeſt that he that was not yet come, is this Beaſt, ver. 12. <hi>Are ten Kings who have not yet received the Kingdome: but ſhall receive power as Kings at one houre with the Beaſt.</hi> Furthermore this Beaſt received his thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and power from the Dragon, ver. 2. who nowe before time had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the woman, that is, the Chriſtian Church. But the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours received their throne and power from none, eſpecially which was be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this time a chiefe enemy to the Chriſtian name, ſeeing the Emperours themſelves are more auncient then the birth of Chriſt himſelfe. Finally the Beaſt is of the ſame time that the flight is, and ſolitarines of the woman. But the Heathen Emperours under the name of the Dragon were togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him in heaven, as wee have shewed in chap 12.3. But there is nothing in the worke of nature, which hath his being before &amp; after him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and is both the originall to it ſelfe, and the image thereof, (which muſt needs be) if wee referre this &amp; the ſeconde Beaſt to Antichriſt alone. It is true indeede that nothing is before and after himſelfe, and both the originall to himſelfe and image thereof, in the ſame, in reſpect of the ſame thing, and at the ſame time; yet in one &amp; the ſame man infancy goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore olde age, and the latter age may be compared to the likenes of the former. Therefore wee conclude that by no meanes this Beaſt is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:6819:182"/> Heatheniſh Empire, much leſſe the Chriſtian. Which in the Throne did not ſucceed the Dragon, but alwayes had his palace either in Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, or in France, or in Germanie. Neither did the whole earth follow with admiration the Empire reſtored, as in ver. 3. nor received his mark, as in ver. 16. but after the renewing, it was limited with ſmall boundes, firſt of <hi>France, Jtaly,</hi> and ſome part of <hi>Germany:</hi> ſecondly, in ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Germany alone, having no juriſdiction over Spaine, Britannie, Hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie, Sclavonie, and the other countries, which yet belonged to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire under another name. Neither to acknowledge the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperour to be ſuch, as he chalengeth to himſelfe, that is to ſay, <hi>the higheſt Magiſtrate in the countries ſubiect unto him,</hi> is an argument of one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to deſtruction, as in the 8. verſe. For Paul profeſſed himſelfe to be a Romane, and appealed to Ceſar, Act. 25.10. Yea <hi>Chriſt acknowledged the Heathen Emperour, and commaunded that he ſhould be obeyed by giving to Ceſar the things which are Ceſars,</hi> Mat. 22.21. Seeing therefore it agreeth not at all to the Emperour, it muſt needs be that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is ſignifyed: whoſe one and the ſame perſon is deſcribed under a double figure of two Beaſts, as may be manifeſt from the 17. chap. where there is taught a declaration of this Chapter, and no mention made of <hi>the ſecond,</hi> but <hi>of the firſt</hi> onely. But why ſo I pray? VVas it not needfull that wee should be inſtructed tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the <hi>ſecond,</hi> whom all men thinke to be either the very <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or at leaſt his <hi>Miniſter</hi> no better then himſelfe? Not at all: but becauſe he that knoweth one, knoweth both: neither doth the <hi>ſecond</hi> make an other perſon, but doth pour ray the ſame image: ſomewhat more playnely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the colours upon the lineaments. And why should not the Beaſt be double, when one Antichriſt is <hi>a double head, the ſeventh and eight?</hi> of which that anſwereth to this firſt Beaſt, this to the ſecond. The reaſon why a dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble type is uſed, is the notable variety, which could not be repreſented fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inough by one. <hi>This Beaſt</hi> hath a double riſing: <hi>from the Sea</hi> and <hi>from the Earth.</hi> He hath alſo a double power: <hi>Civill</hi> and <hi>Spirituall.</hi> In reſpect of the Civill, he is <hi>the firſt,</hi> in regard of the ſpirituall, <hi>the ſecond.</hi> VVhich dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tyranny is moſt plaine in the one <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> ſo as wee can not doubt but that he is both the Beaſts. It is knowne how Boniface the eight in his firſt Iubile, vanted himſelfe openly in the Temple of Peter and Paul, one day coming forth girded with a ſword, and cloathed with an Emperours corſelet: in the ſecond day with a Prelats apparell,, and with a key crying with a loude voice, <hi>Behold here are two ſwordes,</hi> that is, <hi>Behold here is a double Beaſt.</hi> VVhich double power Mantuan doth expreſſe by an elegant car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in theſe wordes:
<q>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:6819:183"/>
                     <l>He is mighty and very ſtrong, with the two ſwordes girded,</l>
                     <l>Magnificent Keiſers and Kings, have his feete worſhipped</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Let then this be the firſt thing, that <hi>the Pope of Rome is this double Beaſt, be cauſe of a double beginning and power: neither is the ſame ſo much celebrated by the wordes and meanes of thoſe of our ſide, as by the Popes themſelves,</hi> as it doth more clearly appeare from the expoſition following. A ſecond thing is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded touching <hi>the time of his beginning:</hi> which I thinke is to be ſet in the very giving over of <hi>Diocletian and Maximin Hercule, when theſe two ſeemed of their owne accord to give over the Empire about the yeere three hundreth and ſixt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath ben declared.</hi> But becauſe none peradventure fetcheth Antichriſt from that head ſpring: and becauſe Bellarmine affirmeth that <hi>all our men doe place the comming of Antichriſt after the ſixe hundreth yeere: and after the death of Gregory the firſt</hi> (although this is to be underſtood of his birth: for our men doe make his conception to be more auncient) that I may not ſeeme alone to have enterpriſed to doe a thing unheard of, I will yeeld rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons of this my judgement, which ſeeme to me to be moſt ſtrong. Firſt this Beaſt ruleth all that time, <hi>wherein the woman lyeth hid in the wildernes, and the two witneſſes prophecy cloathed in ſackecloth,</hi> as is manifeſt after, from the fift verſe, <hi>where power is give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him to doe two and fourtie moneths,</hi> which is the ſame ſpace <hi>of the woman and Prophets.</hi> Now wee evince by neceſſary arguments, that <hi>the woman went into the wildernes, and the witneſſes tooke mourning apparell at that time which wee have ſaid,</hi> when Conſtantine began his raigne: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore alſo the <hi>Beaſt</hi> began in the ſame time to ariſe out of the Sea. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more what other thing meaneth that of Socrates, who lived when Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius Iunior ruled, in the times of Celeſtine Bishop of Rome, about the yeere 424. foure ſcore yeeres after Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantine; <hi>The Romane Biſhopricke, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that of Alexandria, being advanced long ſince beyond the Prieſthood, unto a Princedome:</hi> booke 7. chap. 11. Had he promoted himſelfe beiond the <hi>boundes of the Prieſthood?</hi> Whither elſe I pray, then unto an Antichriſtian ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranny? Had it done this long ſince and of a certen long time? Certenly So crates commeth to my accounte, or rather I to his, or, as it is more agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the trueth, both of us to the reckening of the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe. But he ſpeketh no more of the <hi>Romane,</hi> either here, or before, in book 7. 7. then of the <hi>Alexandrine.</hi> That is true indeede; he in common toucheth ſharply the ambition of both; but the Romane Bishop had many more pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>culiar properties of the true Antichriſt, which in no ſort did belong to the Alexandrine: and therefore although at the firſt they ranne togither it may be with equall ſteppes, yet in short time the Romane got afore, and left the Alexandrine many miles behind him. Hereunto more over is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:6819:183"/> the third <hi>Carthaginean Councill,</hi> about the times of Syricius, to wit in the yeere three hundreth ninetie, which decreed, <hi>that the Biſhop of the firſt ſeate, ſhould not be called the Prince of Prieſts, or Chiefe Prieſt: or any ſuch thing: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely the Biſhop of the firſt Seate: but univerſall, let neither the Biſhop of Rome be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> Can. 26. as it is cited in the ninetieth diſtinction. Wee learne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Decree, what thoſe times had brought forth; otherwiſe it had ben fooliſh and ſuperfluous to make an ordinance touching this matter. Neither is the confeſsion of the Papiſts in this thing to be paſſed over. Doſt thou the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aske the cauſe why <hi>the Romane Biſhops were never preſent at the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills in the Eaſt part?</hi> Bellarmine declareth that it came not to paſſe by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in his firſt booke of the Councill, and of the Church chap. 19. but for a certen conſideration. Which howſoever it was not knowne peradventure to many others, yet it ought to be throughly underſtood of him, a man that is a ſecretarie of the Popes Kingdome. He rendreth two reaſons of this abſence: the firſt, <hi>It ſeemed not to be convenient that the head ſhould follow the members &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>becauſe the Emperour was alwaies preſent at the Councils in the Eaſt part, or ſome Ambaſſadour of his: who challengeth to himſelfe the firſt at leaſt materiall place, otherwiſe then was meete. That either this therefore might not be tolerated, or a tumult mooved, he went not to thoſe Councils, but ſent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his letters.</hi> Such are his wordes: he hath hit the nayle on the head. For the Pope diſdaineth to be preſent at thoſe Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cils, in which the Emp. should ſit before him. How fayre were words give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both to the Emp. Conſtantine and alſo all the <hi>Nicene Fathers?</hi> The good men thought, as Euſebius ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that olde age was a let, that the Preſident of the Lady City of Rome could not be preſent: and therefore were content with the Elders, which ſupplyed his place. But the true cauſe was, that he could not abide, <hi>to give place to the Emperour.</hi> For I beleeve <hi>Bellarmine</hi> rather then Euſebius, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the minde of the Bishop of Rome. VVherefore in the times of the firſt Nicene Councill there was a <hi>man at Rome</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that lifted up one;</hi> who albeit not yet openly, nevertheleſſe within and ſecretly with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was exalted, <hi>above all that is called God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. Not that he vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe to be ſuperiour to God in Heaven (for that is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle) but to all the Gods in earth, to wit the higheſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Imperiall, from whence <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is <hi>worſhipped,</hi> ſeemeth to be added in ſtead of an expoſition. But why doe I be ſtowe much time in theſe things? The matter is out of controverſie from chap. 17. afterward. The ſeventh head of the Beaſt ſucceedeth next after the Heathen Emperours; for theſe make the ſixt, as shalbe ſaid in his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. But Antichriſt is that <hi>ſeventh head,</hi> and therefore hath his beginning by
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:6819:184"/> and by after the Heathen Emperours. Shall I then thinke that all from Miltiades are utterly caſt away, as who doe make this Beaſt, that is, the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry Antichriſt? Farte be from mee ſo great raſhnes of judging. This <hi>Beaſt</hi> is the ſtate of a Kingdome, as I hope ſhalbe moſt cleare after. And therefore God could deliver from the common deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome peculiar men, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought good though furtherers and miniſters of this Kingdome. The impiety was not ſo wicked at the firſt: and the yong Antichriſts did not knowe for what miſchiefe they prepared a way. Therefore wee leave theſe to the infinite and unſearcheable mercy of God, yet wee doubt not, but wee have found out the originall of the riſing Beaſt, which nowe wee ſee to have fallen on that time, in which the <hi>Dragon</hi> was caſt unto the earth, ch. 12.9. For being about to leave heaven, he provided himſelfe of a Vicar, who in his abſence should governe his affaires: whoſe buſines he looked unto, nor careleſly, as wee shall finde afterward. Theſe things being thus ſet in order, wee ſee how from this fountaine, every each thing will flowe moſt eaſily; every part of this Prophecy agreeing moſt fitly one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The true original doubtleſſe not being perceived of the Interpreters, diſordered all conſideration of the times, made a harſh, conſtrained, and abſurd expoſition, and tooke wholly away the right ſearching out of the event. Now as touching the words, the cruelty of Antichriſt is ſignifyed moſt fitly by a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as often in the Scriptures Tyrants are compared unto Wolves and Lions, equall to them in fiercenes, but for hurt worſer, by how much iniquity in men is more armed, becauſe of the force of reaſon. <hi>He did riſe out of the Sea:</hi> becauſe he hath his originall from corrupt doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, to wit the authority of Peters Chaire, falſly bragged of, wherein the Biſhop of Rome glorieth almoſt in every word, and which the auncient ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly men Tertullian, Cyprian, and the reſt, knowing not for what impiety they prepared a way, extolled with exceſsive praiſes. But then chiefly the <hi>Sea was viſible,</hi> and the riſing out of water might appeare to mens eyes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Nicene Fathers caſt the burning mountaine into the Sea; as hath ben ſaid, in the 8. chap. ver. 8. that is when they confirmed by their Decree, that whatſoever preeminence there was, should be given to Rome, over the neighbour Bishops. For the <hi>Sea</hi> noteth togither with the Doctrine, the Clergie, whoſe office is to take paine in miniſtring the Doctrine. Thoſe holy men were farre from bringing in the Tyranny, which was after ſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: yet they unwares gave a notable increaſe to it, by this their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. <hi>Before the Nicene Councill every one lived to himſelfe, and little regard was had to the Church of Rome:</hi> as Aeneas Silvius confeſſeth. This then eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the riſing of the Beaſt: not that he began not to riſe up before, but
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:6819:184"/> becauſe now firſt he could be ſeen and marked of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Which had ſeven heads:</hi> Such was his riſing. His integrall partes are, firſt his <hi>Heads,</hi> which are as many, <hi>and the ſame which the Dragon had</hi> in ch. 12.3. For there is the ſame <hi>ſeate</hi> &amp; <hi>dignitie</hi> of them both. For <hi>theſe heads are Hilles and Kings,</hi> as in chap. 17.9.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>He hath alſo ten hornes,</hi> as the Dragon, <hi>and ten crownes ſet on his hornes.</hi> Which ten crownes, <hi>are ten Kings,</hi> chap. 17.11. Yet nevertheleſſe differing in two ſorts from the hornes of the Dragon. Firſt, <hi>in the crownes</hi> with which theſe are adorned, as which doe note out Kings, not to be ſubject to the Empire of an other man, but who should have a free and ſupreme mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of things. The <hi>Hornes of the Dragon</hi> had no ſuch adorning, but this ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour did belong onely to <hi>the heads,</hi> as in chap. 12.3. Whence commeth the difference? Becauſe the Heathen Emperours placed the ſeat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyre <hi>at Rome, whereof they are the ſeaven heads:</hi> eſtabliſhing her the Empreſſe and Queene of all. And therefore the crownes being taken away from all other Kings and Provinces, <hi>they have impoſed them upon the ſeven heads or hills of this.</hi> But nowe there should be an other face of things, Antichriſt at length shewing himſelfe. For the maieſty of the Empire should not remai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne at Rome, but should have her ſeate in ſome other country: for which cauſe <hi>the crownes,</hi> which before did belong to the <hi>heads,</hi> now for a newe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect are tranferred to the <hi>hornes.</hi> Secondly, they differ in time. For <hi>the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Beaſt were not yet bred, when John wrote,</hi> chap. 17.12. The <hi>hornes of the Dragon,</hi> even before Iohn was borne, were lifted up on high, ſpread with many branches, as wee have ſeen in chap. 12.3. Therefore although they agree in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, yet they are not the ſame in all things, neither should one doe well, if he should apply to the head of that, things that belong to this. But finally, what are theſe hornes? All things being diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I thinke that they were <hi>the ten firſt Chriſtian Emperours.</hi> Of counting whom there may be a double way: one, of every ſeverall by himſelfe, and of them onely in whoſe power was either the univerſall Empire, or that of the Weſt. Into which Catalogue doe come <hi>Conſtantine the Great, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtans, Conſtantine his ſonnes, IVLIANVS, Iovianus, Valentinianus, Gratianus, Valentinianus the ſecond, Theodoſius.</hi> And ſo there is a great conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the things done and of the Prophecy. For while theſe ten did raigne, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was defended excellently, &amp; his dignity much increaſed. Which at length being taken away, the hornes being as it were broken for a time, the ſucceeding Emperours were not able to maintaine the ſame authority of the <hi>Romiſh Beaſt,</hi> which thoſe predeceſſours had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of that <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſufferred Rome to be taken and ſpoiled of the Gothes.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:6819:185"/> And although for the ſpace of two yeeres it was beſeeged by Alaricus, he abiding at Rave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na, either was not able, or durſt not ſuccour it, the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the Hornes was ſo much abated. VVhere was his Fathers valiantneſſe, which killed and put to flight enemies in ſo great numbers, even in the furtheſt boundes of Rome? But neither from the Eaſt was there now any aide, but the hornes being as it were broken, wherby the former Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours removed ſo farre of the Barbarous people: the <hi>Beaſt with his Rome</hi> was a pray to the moſt contemptible nations. But there ſeemeth to be a more full accord, and in every part more agreable from a conjoyned rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening of the Emperours, both of the weſt, and of the Eaſt, after the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner of all the Chronicle writers.

                  <hi>¶ And the Dragon gave him his power, and throne:</hi> Thus farre the naturall forme <hi>of the Beaſt:</hi> the power followeth; and that in the firſt place, which he received firſt. <hi>The Dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Power</hi> is an inſet ſtrength. <hi>Authority</hi> is that which is exerciſed towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the <hi>Dragon</hi> gave him both, and his <hi>throne</hi> beſides. And this is <hi>Rome,</hi> the city with ſeven hilles, as wee have ſeen before in the 12. chapter ver. 3. VVhich the <hi>Dragon</hi> Diocletian and Maximian being to be thruſt out of heaven, gave to <hi>the Beaſt the Pope,,</hi> that he might performe his buſineſſe at leaſt by his Procurour, when he could doe it no longer by himſelfe: &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeede the Dragon, as ſoone as he perceived that he muſt depart, tooke order for a Succeſſour, <hi>putting the Beaſt in poſſeſſion,</hi> before his expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Diocletian lived at Nicomedia, Maximian at Mediolanum, in the which places both of them gave over the Empire: leaving in the meane ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Rome empty for the Beaſt. Maxentius held it after for a fewe yeeres, but onely as one that hath the cuſtodie of a thing upon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reſtore it, as the event hath declareth; who should not have the Throne for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but should keepe it for the Pope. Conſtantine comming to viſite Rome afterward, and finding the Throne poſſeſſed of an other, went to
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:6819:186"/> Byzantium called ſince Conſtantinople, and there appointed a place for himſelfe to dwell in. The other that followed, Emperours of the VVeſt part, when as the inrodes of the Barbarous people did moleſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they might be neerer to bring aide, and more ready for every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, abode at Mediolanum, or at Ravenna, as the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places. So <hi>they by little and little left the Throne to the Beaſt. Wherby at length that which letted was wholly taken away, and the man of ſinne was revealed to all men,</hi> as in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians chapter 2. verſ 6. From which nowe it is perceived that this Beaſt is not the Romane Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Empire, which received Rome by the gift of none; neither doeth account his power and dignity as received of any, unleſſe peradventure the Dragon did purſue the woman of whom wee ſpake like an enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Heathen Emperours were begotten. Furthermore, the Pope of Rome is the Beneficiarie of <hi>the Dragon,</hi> and not of <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> neither hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth Rome by his <hi>Donation,</hi> as he boaſteth falſly and impudently: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the aſsignement of the Dragon. Thus therefore the Throne being gotten, Rome began from that day to be famous, rather for the <hi>Popes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> then for the Emperours Court. And indeede it grewe very quickly, and her power waxed great in a short time; as Proſper witneſſeth in his booke <hi>de Ingratis,</hi> in theſe wordes, <hi>Rome is the Seate of Peter, which is become the Head of Paſtorall power to the world: whatſoever ſhee holdeth not by force of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, ſhee holdeth it by religion.</hi> And againe in his ſecond booke of the calling of the Gentils, chap. 6. <hi>Rome by the ſoveraigntie of Prieſthood is more increaſed, by the tower of religion, then by the Throne of power.</hi> Vnto which is added Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mian Marcellin, in his 27. booke, as he is cited by Bellarmine, <hi>that he mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vaileth not, though men contend with ſo great deſire for the Romane Popedome, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the riches and maieſtie of it are ſo great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the Dragon gave him this power appeareth from hence, that the name of Rome was honourable to all men, becauſe of the auncient Empire, of which once it was the Seate; and therefore that they eaſily yeel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to any promotion of hers; but of this more largely at the 6. verſe.</p>

                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:6819:187"/> The dammage conſiſteth <hi>in the wounding of one of his heads,</hi> which now once or twice wee have advertiſed to be <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hills and Kings,</hi> from chap. 17.9.10. VVhether then of theſe kindes should ſuffer this calamity? Surely if the wounde inflicted, be to come into the power of the enemy, ſcarce can one of the hilles receive a wound, but all wilbe wounded togither. VVherfore more properly it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the Kings, any one of which being afflicted with this wounde, the reſt abide whole from the ſame. Although this hurt cannot be ſo proper to a <hi>King,</hi> that it should not alſo be common to the <hi>Hills.</hi> And theſe Kings are ſeven Governements, or Principalities, by which the City of Rome hath ben governed, to wit, thoſe celebrated by all, <hi>Kings, Conſuls, Decemviri, Dictatours, Tribunes, Emperours, Popes,</hi> as wee will make plaine at the 17. chap. If now it be demaunded to which of all theſe this calamity should happen, the place which even now wee ſpake of declareth it evidently: <hi>to the ſeaven head,</hi> namely, <hi>the Popes.</hi> For ſo ſpeaketh the Angell, <hi>and another,</hi> that is, <hi>the ſeventh is not yet come: and when he ſhall come, he muſt continue a ſhort ſpace:</hi> being hurt with a wound, as it were quite killed with the ſame: for Iohn ſaith, <hi>as it were wounded to death,</hi> as Aretas well puts us in minde, for he should not be altogither deſtroyed by this blow. But now after that it is manifeſt touching <hi>the Heads,</hi> this wound was inflicted, when Rome forſaken now a good while of the Emperours, abiding partly in the Eaſt at <hi>Byzantium,</hi> partly in the Weſt at <hi>Ravenna:</hi> &amp; beginning againe to flouriſh under a newe Governeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>of Popes,</hi> was ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with an exceeding great ſtorme by <hi>the Gothes, Vandals, Hunnes, and the reſt of the Northern people.</hi> Which vexed moſt miſerably the whole VVeſt part. In this common calamity, <hi>that late Empreſſe of the nations,</hi> &amp; <hi>Queene of the whole world,</hi> eſcaped not ſcotfree, but ſufferred a greater deſtruction, then almoſt any City beſides, oftener taken by aſſault, ſacked, waſted, &amp; for <hi>an hundred two and thirtie yeeres, at the luſt of the Barbarians.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Alaricus</hi> about the yeere 415 beſieged and tooke it: Of which thing Hierome ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king: <hi>but after</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the moſt famous light of all countries is cleane put out, yea the head of the Romane Empire cut off, and to ſpeake more truly, the whole world is deſtroyed in one Citie &amp;c.</hi> In his Proheme of Ezech. But in more wordes &amp; eloquently in an Epiſtle to Principia a Virgin: <hi>The Citie is taken, which tooke the whole world &amp;c.</hi> In what lamentable manner would he have bewailed, if it had befell him to heare of the ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conquerings and ſpoiling thereof, which followed? For Rome now was conſumed not once, but was taken a ſecond time by Adaulphus, who gave her ſuch a deadly wound, that ſhe was minded to change her name, and to be called afterward <hi>Gothia.</hi> The third time <hi>Genſericus the Vandal</hi> tooke it. The fourth time, <hi>Odoacer Rugianus</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:6819:187"/> reigning there fourteene yeeres. <hi>Theodoricus the King of the Gothes</hi> ſlewe him whom at length <hi>Totilas</hi> followeth by a cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He the fift time overthrew and raſed it, bringing it to that wilderneſſe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any man, nor woman could be found in it by the ſpace of fourty dayes, according to that of the Sibyll: <hi>Rome ſhalbe a perpetuall ruine, and ſhee that hath ben ſeen, ſhall not be diſcerned.</hi> Albeit I thinke not that shee hath yet endured that calamity, which Sibyll ſpeaketh of, although that now paſt, may be a notable proofe of that which is to come. Who in thoſe times, would not have thought, that the ſeven hilled Citie had utterly periſhed? VVho would not have ſuppoſed that <hi>the dignitie of the Popes,</hi> to wit, <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth head,</hi> had bin paſt remedy? Therefore the Conſtantinopolitane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and he of Ravennas, the authority of Rome being as it were utterly gone, laboured greatly, as the next heires, to drawe the ſame to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches. But they were both much deceaved. The head was not wounded un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to death, but as it were, unto death. Therefore the wound waxing more fierce, <hi>Zozimus, Bonifacius, Celeſtinus,</hi> about the yeere 420. having ſuppoſed a Nicene Councill, chalenged the Primacy: and they did moove ſo much as was ſufficient to shewe, that ſome life was left: but they had a shameful repulſe; becauſe this was the time <hi>of the wound</hi> on every ſide. Pelagius alſo not long after, before the skarre had cloſed altogither, wreſted the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the ſame ende, but his endevour comming to no proofe, declared that both <hi>the head</hi> remained alive, and alſo that it was of no power. For the raigne of the Gothes, darkened the light of the <hi>Popes dignity:</hi> neither could now any acknowledg her <hi>the chiefe,</hi> who at home being <hi>the baſeſt,</hi> and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Barbarous people, ſcarce had a place where to abide. For at once the Emperours dwelling at Rome, at what time the Apoſtles were in authority, reſtreined Antichriſt, that he could not come forth, to be ſeen abroad: ſo the new erected Kingdome of the Gothes in Italie, was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing with holding, which did repell his put out hornes for a time, &amp; compelled him againe, to hide him ſelfe in his shell. Rightly therefore now, the head did ſeeme to be wounded, which was not able to shake off the yoke, neither by any ſtrength of his owne, neither by any hope that he had from the Eaſt; ſeing the Emperour had graunted of his owne accord, Italy to the Gothes, which he had no hope to be able to retaine. VVhat could he expect from the VVeſt, every country wanting helpe; ſo farre off were they, from being able to ſuccour others? Therefore <hi>O Pope,</hi> thy wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was deadly, whereof no remedie appeared from any place.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And all the world wondred &amp; followed the Beaſt:</hi> Now he declareth how great the recovered dignity ſhould be: &amp; firſt by the <hi>honour which the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Beaſt ſhould give to him:</hi> this honour is in <hi>admiring,</hi> in this verſe, &amp; alſo <hi>in worſhipping both the Dragon &amp; the Beaſt,</hi> in the following. And he ſpeaketh ſignifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly after the Hebrewes manner, <hi>to wonder after the Beaſt,</hi> which is as much as in wondring, to follow the Beaſt: that is to give up the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to be ruled by his Empire, as <hi>the Iſraelites going a whoring after their Idols,</hi> forſooke the true God, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to the worship of them. They who ſo admired the Beaſt are <hi>the earth,</hi> that is men ſavouring the earth, altogither ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly city. But how many is the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them? All without exception. For he ſaith, <hi>the whole earth.</hi> Therefore it should come to paſſe that the Beaſt after the head was healed, should ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le with farre larger boundes, then before. Proſper ſaid that Rome was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:6819:188"/> more ample, at the firſt receiving of this dignity by <hi>the tower of religion then by the throne of power.</hi> Which ſeemeth to be underſtood rather of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the trueth, then of the dominion of the Citie of Rome, although then it was doubtleſſe large. The trueth was propagated further then the Romane Empire: But Britanny had not yet acknowledged the authoritie of Rome in the matter of religion, till under the Pontificate of Gregory the fift, that is, after ſome hope that the wound should be cured: Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine the Romish Munke forced our countriemen, to take upon them the yoke: neither did France, Friſeland, Denmarke, Germanie, Sclavonia, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pend much of Rome, before Bonifacius, or Venefride an Ingliſhman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeere 720. brought theſe countries or the chiefe parts thereof unto the obedience of the Pope of Rome. Now therefore was the time, when <hi>the whole earth ſhould admire the Beaſt:</hi> when beſides theſe and other Princes of Europe, countries alſo moſt remote, Ireland, Scotland, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Gothia, Sueveland, Luten, and other nations of Sarmatia, honoured the ſame as ſome God. Let therefore the Pope glory in his univerſality: by how much he hath the greater multitude, by ſo much a ſurer argument is he <hi>that Beaſt.</hi> But as touching the admiration, it was indeede great ſome ages before, and that of the moſt famous lights of the Church: who carry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed away with the too much honour of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and not regarding ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to what miſchiefe at length the matter would growe; did exalte too proudly the preheminence of the Apoſtolike Chaire. Yet did <hi>they not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after the Beaſt,</hi> ſo as they thought they muſt embrace all whatſoever he should ordaine, but they had one rule of godlineſſe and duty, to it, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred trueth. Neither were the commendations of thoſe times, any thing to that admiration which followed the healing of the wounde.

               <p n="4">4 <hi>And they worſhipped the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> That is, men acknowledged the power of the Beaſt to be by right the chiefe, becauſe of the auncient majeſty of Rome, which the Heathen Emperours, who are thoſe Dragons, procured unto it. For was not this to adore and worship the Dragon, for his ſake to give the ſupreme dignitie to his ſucceſſour? But this was the firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romane Primacy, becauſe this Citie was a fore time the head city of the Empire. From hence every where in Euſebius and other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall writers, it is called the <hi>raigning Citie.</hi> But moſt clearly doth the Councill of Chalcedon shew this, in the 16. Act. <hi>For the Fathers in order gave privilegies to the Seate of olde Rome, becauſe of the Empire of that Citie. An hundred and fifty Biſhops, moſt loving to God, and of equall Seate, moved with the ſame intention, gave privilegies to the newe Rome; iudging according to reaſon, that the Citie adorned with the Empire, and Senate, ſhould enioy the like privilegies of the auncient Rome: and in Ecclefiaſticall affaires to have authority as ſhee, and to be the next after her &amp;c.</hi> Therefore the Empire and Senate did bring forth the Primacy to the elder Rome: which being graunted unto her by thoſe firſt Fathers, becauſe of the Heathen Emperours, who raigned there afore time: the Succeſſours afterward, did for the ſame cauſe, amplify the digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty graunted, and proſtrate themſelves all shamefully before the Dragon, worshipping him as the authour of this honour. By the ſame argument the Bishop of Conſtantinople would have obtained the like dignity. But
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:6819:189"/> the Dragon ſufferred it not, who had made the Bishop of Rome his heire of the whole. Wherefore the Legates of <hi>the Romane Biſhop</hi> withſtood that Decree. Neither would Pope Gelaſius, who in other things approved the Concill of Chalcedon, confirme this one Canon, concerning the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of the Church of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople. Therefore that Decree was of noe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, eſpecially when the ſame Gelaſius, to whom the Dragon had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his power, had ordained wiſely before, and warily; <hi>that no Act of any Councill whatſoever, ſhould be of any force, unleſſe it were confirmed the Biſhop of Rome.</hi>

                  <hi>¶ And they worſhipped the Beaſt ſaying, who is like to the Beaſt? who can warre with him:</hi> Such was the worshipping of the Dragon: now followed of the Beaſt: which conſiſteth in the extolling of his power above all; that wee may not thinke, that adoration is in the geſture onely. And was there not iuſt cauſe of boaſting ſo highly of the Beaſts power? Leo Iſaurus the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour of Conſtantinople fought unfortunately with Gregory the ſecond, excommunicated by the ſame, and put from all the Empire of the Weſt. Childericke the King of France, was too weake for to encounter with the Pope Zachary: wherefore forced by his authority, he gave over his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to Pipine. The Longobards not uſing the Beaſt well, when he was ſicke of his wounde; at length whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he began to be recovered, and to waxe well, were caſt into the jawes of this Leopard, by the helpe of <hi>Pipine</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great.</hi> Neither loſt Charles his coſt, being made Emperour for his labour. Great indeede was thy power ô Beaſt, who wert able at thy pleaſure to take away, and to give againe, that which is the higheſt in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s affaires. Lamentable is the Hiſtory of Henry the fourth, who in the heart of a terrible winter, bare foote, and faſting from morning to night, for the ſpace of three dayes, waited for ſentence, craving pardon before the gates of the Canuſine Caſtell of the Romane Bishop: who yet prevayled no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, eyther by his owne or others teares, or by the interceſsion of any Sanct, ſave onely of a <hi>certen whore,</hi> whom the Holy Pope had made his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling The Emperour was deceived, who thought that the Pope could be pacifyed by prayers and faſting: this God required an other kinde of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fices. But that is horrible that the Pope drove rhe Sonne of Henry to that wickedneſſe, that he should aſſault his Father with warre, ſpoiled him of all dignity, and at length conſtrained him to ende his life in extreame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.

For ſo wee shall learne from other ſcriptures that he shall utterly perish about that time. It may be that his deſtruction shall prevent this terme: for neither doe I now recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> curiouſly, neither peradventure doe the Hiſtory-writers nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the yeeres ſo faithfully as is meete. But it shall not be graunted him to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the furtheſt ſpace being ſet downe by mee.

               <p>In which reſpect as they begin togither with the moneths and dayes of <hi>the woman and Prophets,</hi> ſo alſo they have an ende togither. The mention of the <hi>warre with the Sancts</hi> beneath in the 17. verſe, confirmeth this ſenſe: which warre wee have declared to have befallen at the ende of theſe moneths, in chap. 11.7. From which expoſition the <hi>Beaſt is ſaid to have power to doe two and fourty moneths,</hi> of the moſt part of theſe moneths: becauſe that ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance of time, in which he should hide himſelfe by reaſon <hi>of his wounded head,</hi> should have a very little reckening made of it, in reſpect of the whole number: neither is the power which shalbe afterward, like to that of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time; as the experience of this time proveth ſufficiently, wherein wee ſee the Popes forces, ſince that warre was made, that is, ſince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Trent, are become a great deale feebler and weaker: ſo that his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is almoſt nothing to that, which it was in former ages.

For now indeede, the Beaſt began upon the earth, who not onely exerciſed <hi>a powre over the Eccleſiaſticall route,</hi> but alſo bridled the lay men by his authority, &amp; their chiefe head the Emperour: who although before time he had given a great power to the Pope over the Clergie, yet he preſſed downe the ſame even till now by his maieſty, as it were by a certen weight, more heavie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Hill Aetna; that he should not lift up his creſts above the Emperour. But now the earthly dignity yeeldeth to <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> to be troden under foote of him at length, who grew up ſo farre onely by the favour of the Emperours. Therefore Zacharias the next, that it might be manifeſt to all men that <hi>the Popes were now looſed from the priſon of eartly dignity, depoſed Childericke the King of France, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Pipine the Father of Charles the Great, to be created King in his ſtead.</hi> But yet it was more cleare in Leo the third, who tranſlated the Empire fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Grecians to the Germanes, and annointed Charles the Great for Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour. VVhat a more great proofe can there be of the ſupreme power on earth, then to take away the Empire from whom he will, and to beſtowe the ſame againe upon whom he shall thinke good? The Popes following perſiſted in the ſame ſteppes, eſteeming the Emperours as it were balles, in reiecting the ſame from their office, and appointing other in their roome at their pleaſure. VVhereby Bellarmine being moved, wrote indeede tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and agreable to this Prophecy. <hi>All the Emperours who have ben ſince Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les the Great, are bound to the Pope for their Empire:</hi> in his 5. booke of the Pope of Rome, chap. 8. For ever ſince that time <hi>the Beaſt roſe up from the earth,</hi> being higher then all earthly power: to which are added earthly dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and poſſeſsions of landes ioyned with this originall: which the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time either wanted altogither, or at leaſt enioyed but ſmall &amp; fewe, as great as were ſufficient to maintaine a Bishop, not which should make any shew of a Kingdome. For in former ages, Italy was tributary to the Emperours, which at length the Gothes poſſeſsing, made it to pay tribute to them: when they were ſlaine under Iuſtinian, it returned againe to the Empire, adminiſtred by Captaines. The Romane Pope had yet noe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, untill this earthly riſing up, had given him landes ſufficiently. For is it likely that the Pope by whoſe perſuaſion other men fell from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and were made richer, became not more enriched by the ſpoiles of the ſame?

Deſiderius the Longobard felt the force of this voice, who being allured by the Lambelike shewe of the Popes, he en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tered quickly into their poſſeſsions, for to recover whatſoever things they had wreſted away by fraude from his Ancetours. But this voice brought to paſſe, that while he ſtrove for ſome one citie or towne, he loſt his whole Kingdome, and that not from himſelfe, but alſo the whole name of the <hi>Longobardes.</hi> Theſe are wonderfull great actes of the <hi>Earthly Beaſt,</hi> taking away and beſtowing Kingdomes at his pleaſure. And that which is more, not ſo much by armed force, as by his voice, by which he exerciſed the power of the <hi>Dragon:</hi> although he bare yet the ſhewe of a tender Lambe, who was not able of himſelfe to drive away the wolfe from his owne necke.</p>

His power is equall with the former, a great proofe whereof is given in this verſe. As touching the equall power, whatſoever that firſt could doe, this ſecond doth exerciſe all the ſame in his ſight. But whence had he this ſo great power, but from the Dragon who gave it to the <hi>firſt</hi> above in the ſecond verſe?

Neither is any other thing at this day ſo greatly laboured for, as that the auncient honour may be given to the Pope, that is, that the firſt Beaſt may be worshipped: it would be an unpleaſant ambition openly to endevour to get honour to himſelfe (though the Pope is not ashamed of this) wherefore he obiecteth <hi>the firſt Beaſt,</hi> under whoſe name he may ſerve himſelfe more ſecretly.</p>

But, wilt thou ſay the miracles of other men are not fewe. That is true in deede: but who ar all the ſlaves of the ſame Pope: of whom whatſoever wonders are done, they are referred to the defending, preſerving, and increaſing of his digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, as to the centre.

For, that it cannot agree to the death of one man, fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſome fewe dayes, it shalbe manifeſt from the perſon of Antichriſt, which the ſeventeenth chapter after will proove evidently, to be a long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſsion of many, not any certen and ſingular man. Eſpecially alſo ſeeing that this wound was very ſorrowfull, not inflicted on himſelfe willingly, and in jeſt, but made by his enemies, where could be no place for counter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faiting. Which faining of death was brought in by a falſe coniecture of men, and beſides the trueth of the matter, and the very wordes of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture. Therfore the <hi>Rom.

Therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt that he might not ſeeme inferiour to the famous Prophets, would ſet foorth himſelfe by this ſort of miracles.

                  </gap>, there is this difference, that a man maketh an image of ſome body, as a Painter, or Carver of Images, who fashioneth an Image for gaine, or for his minde ſake: but he maketh an Image to ſome body, who maketh it for the ſake, or honour of ſome body. But this Image is not any colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red picture, or image made of any matter. For <hi>all muſt be ſlaine, that will not worſhip this,</hi> in the next verſe; but an Image made cannot come unto all men, unleſſe either it be carried through all countries, or if it shall have a fixed place, all leave their dwelling places, for to goe thither into a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge country. Furthermore <hi>this Image</hi> shall effect by his owne ſtrength, <hi>that whoſoever ſhall refuſe this worſhip, he may be killed,</hi> as in the next verſe. But this power is greater, then can agree either to a picture, or Image, howſoever wee have read that ſome have ſpoken at ſome time by the cunning of the Devill. Neither are the Images of living men wonte to be thruſt upon the people to be worshipped: Images indeede may be ſet up for living men, but onely for civill honour, not religious worship. Therefore this Image is not any picture of the body, but a lively and expreſſe figure of honour, Kingdome, power, which the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> should carry of the former. For
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:6819:197"/> this is that which the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſtriveth for, that in his perſon the firſt may be revived. VVhich his wicked ambition is declared moſt ſignificantly in this kind of ſpeaking. For firſt, when he deſireth earneſtly <hi>an image to be put to the firſt Beaſt,</hi> by the ſame he sheweth, that he doth require no newe thing, but onely the shadow of that olde thing, the trueth whereof had bin in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. VVhich cunning wee called before, <hi>the fained name of Antiquity,</hi> above in the 12. verſe. From whence alſo it may be manifeſt, that the firſt Beaſt was not the Emperours, but onely the Pope. For it had ben an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt and impudent requeſt, if the Pope had chalenged openly to himſelfe, the honour of the Emperours; but he requireth nothing but that which was proper to the former Popes; who would not thinke that he ought to condeſcende to ſo reaſonable a demande? Furthermore this image decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth what manner of honour he deſireth to obtaine among his worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to wit, ſuch as the Idolaters doe give to their Images, for <hi>he will ſit in the hearts and conſciences of men, as an Jdoll,</hi> as it appeareth manifeſtly from the adoration, and admiration whereof wee ſpake before. He deſireth him ſelfe to be eſteemed God; but the Spirit calleth him by a true name, a falſe God and an Image. The Spirit acknowledgeth not that foolish difference betweene <hi>Image</hi> &amp; <hi>Jdoll,</hi> which of late the Idolaters have forged. But is it not more cleare then the light, that ſuperſtitious men have exalted theſe latter Popes to be certen divine maieſties, and not ſimply unto the former glory of the auncient Popes, which ſeemed to have bin utterly abolished by the warres of the Gothes, and their dominion in Italy? Doe not the ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me men worship this newe framed <hi>Image,</hi> as an Idoll? See thoſe thinges which wee have ſpoken at the 6. and 9. verſes. VVhereunto many other might be added, unleſſe it were needleſſe in a matter appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inough to the whole world.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>And it was given unto him, to give a ſpirit to the Image:</hi> After that men began to worship the revived Beaſt, an image of the former, as it were an Idoll, to the ende that this who is his crafts maiſter might the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the people, he should <hi>endue the Image with a vitall faculty.</hi> He alludeth to the Devilliſh arts of the Idolaters, wherby they effected that the Idols should utter oracles with diſtinct voices, that they might wrap the mindes of men in greater ſuperſtition.

And this is the third miracle, farre more wonderfull indeede, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if ſome image or picture ſhould utter a lowde voice: for this is noe newe thing, both renowmed from thoſe heathen oracles much ſpoken of, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo being the accuſtomed play of the Magitians: but that this image of the Papiſts should thunder with ſo terrible a voice, it was a thing which the world for good cauſe ſhould be aſtonied at. In this wiſe therefore wee ſee this Pope <hi>a miracle worker,</hi> famous for theſe three ſortes of miracles, by the which even the Papiſts themſelves graunte, that Antichriſt should be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably knowne.</p>
               <p>

For the marke eyther of the othe, or ordination and ſuch rites, is not printed in all the people (for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longe to the Clergie, Great States, and others who execute a publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) but there is an other eaſier, and readier way, wherby the multitude may profeſſe themſelves to be among the proper goods of the ſame Lord, to wit, ſo taking upon them his name, as in olde time ſervants did: that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the Prince himſelfe is called <hi>Catholike, Prelate, Pope:</hi> ſo they <hi>Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, Biſhopiſts, Papiſts.</hi> Of olde ſome of theſe names were common, but at length the Pope chalenged them to himſelfe; neither will he have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be Catholikes now, ſave thoſe that are of his heard. And although theſe names doe flow to all his ſubiects withot difference, yet <hi>the common ſorte</hi> are knowne by this badge onely, the other being marked with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liar marke beſide. But what need is there nowe of a third note? The two former containe the whole company of vile perſons of this Kingdome. There is an other kinde of men ſomewhat further removed from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Beaſt, then that which even nowe I ſpake of. VVhich unleſſe it will be marked at leaſt with <hi>the number of his name,</hi> muſt knowe, that they are reſtrained from the uſe of any kinde of marchandiſe with the ſubjects of <hi>this Beaſt.</hi> But theſe ſeeme to be <hi>the Grecians,</hi> who unleſſe they would ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke upon them <hi>the number of this name,</hi> should be eſteemed banished men from this Empire, and all the emoluments, which might be gotten in the ſame. The <hi>Number of his name</hi> is the very ſame that a name expreſſed by a number, or, that I may ſo ſay, <hi>a name of number.</hi> VVhich ſeeing it ſhalbe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de manifeſt to be <hi>Latinus,</hi> from thoſe thinges which shalbe ſpoken on the next verſe, the trueth of this Prophecy is wonderfully well knowne, even from this part alſo: for the <hi>Beaſt</hi> before time did purſue the Grecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with ſo great hatred, that although he ſawe them miſerably ſpoiled of all their neighbours, would ſuffer no aide to be carried to them from the VVeſt, untill Michaell Paleologus about the yeere 1273. at Lions in Fraunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with Gregory the X. to make himſelfe and all his people ſubiect to <hi>the number of the name of the Beaſt,</hi> that is, promiſed that all his people here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:6819:200"/> should give all ſoveraigntie to the <hi>Latine Pope.</hi> Therefore of the three markes <hi>the Character</hi> pertaineth to great States and the Clergy, as Sonnes. <hi>The name</hi> to the people and common ſort, as boundmen. But <hi>the number of his name</hi> to the Grecians being ſtrangers.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>Here is wiſedome: he that hath underſtanding &amp;c.</hi> Now he exhorteth us to number this name. From which exhortation, if wee shall conſider it di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligently, ſome things may be learned, by which wee shallbe lead into the true knowledge of <hi>the name.</hi> For firſt, why should he require diligence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>the number of the name,</hi> then eyther in <hi>the marke,</hi> or in <hi>the name of the Beaſt?</hi> It is manifeſt that this exhortation belongeth to the third member. But <hi>the Character,</hi> or <hi>name of the Beaſt</hi> had ſerved for a more certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and made more plaine. VVherefore their affection was to be ſtirred up rather to the ſearching out of theſe things, from which they might hav hope of a greater fruit. The reaſon why theſe are omitted, and that alone is ſet before us to be conſidered, ſeemeth to be this, becauſe <hi>the number of the name</hi> might beginne at what time Iohn wrote. The Character and the name had not yet taken beginning, even as neither the <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelfe, as wee have shewed: from whence they came under no accounte, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The names indeede of Bishops were common, even in thoſe firſt ages: but the ſtate of them then was of an other ſort, then after that they were turned into a name proper to a certen man. The exhortation hath reſpect to the ſame ende: <hi>Here is wiſdome: let him that is endued with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding count the number:</hi> How great a torment had it ben to learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that age, to aſſay a thing altogither impoſsible? VVould they not for juſt cauſe have abſtained from the labour of ſeeking of that thing, to finde out which they could have no hope? The e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>devour of divers of them shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, that this opinion prevailed not in time paſt, as though this wiſdome should belong to the time to come, in no wiſe to their time.</p>
               <p>Let this then be the firſt property; <hi>That the number of the name might be knowne, even to that age in which Iohn lived, not onely to himſelfe by revelation, but alſo to another by ſearching out and ſtudy.</hi> Secondly it is expreſſely delivered that it is <hi>the number of a man,</hi> that is, ſuch a name of a man, from whoſe letters of number, ariſeth this <hi>number.</hi> VVhich yet is not the proper name of the Beaſt. For it was <hi>the number of a man,</hi> before the Beaſt was. Neither could it remaine in one perſon of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flourishing at that time, when Iohn was. For then the counting had bene uncertaine, doubtfull, and impoſsible. But it is <hi>the name of a nation,</hi> paſsing from one man unto ſome whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the number ſhewed obſcurely and darkely, declareth that it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:6819:200"/> at that time to publiſh this name before all the world.</hi> For to what purpoſe is this darke shewing of the matter but to avoide an unneceſſary offenſe? Whereunto Paul agreeth: <hi>but now yee know what withholdeth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.6. From which it appeareth that the Apoſtles taught ſecretly the Churches co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Antichriſt, the which was not expedient for to be carried foorth into the wicked world. Not becauſe through feare of danger they thought it were to be concealed cowardly, but becauſe before the Beaſt roſe up, when his name yet was not neceſſary, they would have the Church to be without needleſſe troubles. A fourth common property ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the former verſe to theſe three, which are taken out of this verſe; to wit, <hi>that this number doth looſe them from the bond of prohibited entercourſe of marchandiſe, who doe ſuffer themſelves to be marked with the ſame.</hi> All which now being ioyned togither have this ſumme: <hi>That the number of name is a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral name of ſome m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For aſſoone as the names shalbe examined by this rule of certaine trueth, which are brought of Interpreters, wee ſhall finde how all beſide one are abſurd. Some by a certen property doe reſemble this number: of which ſort I have knowne two. The firſt which Franc. Iunius a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man, and a great light of the Church bringeth, who will have this number to be <hi>the Popiſh learning, and the Canon lawe,</hi> as he calleth it, <hi>eſpecially in the ſixt booke of Decretales, added to the five former by Boniface the eight. For this number is perfect, and divers times rebounding perfectly from his partes: neither is there any part of the Popiſh lawe, which is not referred to his head, or contained therein. The Beaſt teacheth this name alſo, and maketh it, as it were a marke of his people.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding ſeeing this name belongeth to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> farre ſpent and very olde, and not that auncient one, which was before his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, neither the name of any man, it ſeemeth leſſe to agree: eſpecially ſeeing here is no danger, why a covert ſpeaking of it should be neceſſary: neither laſtly doth this name appertaine to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who leaſt doe cleave to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of which ſorte is the <hi>nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the name</hi> above ver. 17; but to the <hi>Beaſts darlings, the Canoniſts,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>A name ſurely very fit, ſeeing Antichriſt vaunteth himſelfe above every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me on earth.

It is not likely that that now should be concealed by a darke ſpeach, which before was noiſed through all the Church.

For ſo Ireneus in his 5. book chap 29. againſt hereſies, <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the name Lateinos conteineth the num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber ſixe hundred threeſcore and ſixe: and it is very like to be true, becauſe the moſt ſubſtantiall Kingdome hath this name, for they are Latines who now doe raigne. But wee will not boaſt of this.</hi> Such are his wordes. As though this were not the opinion of him alone, but he had received it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another: but from what other man is it likely, then from Polycarp, whoſe ſcholar he was, and he Iohns ſcholar? Such therefore are theſe Beaſts, whoſe lively image wee ſee in the <hi>Romane Pope,</hi> who according to the plaine interpretation of the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, the events of the times, and agreablenes of all things, ſo fitly without any violence caſteth himſelfe into every part of this firſt paterne, and that even to the leaſt appearances, and likeneſſes, that I thinke the very Papiſts themſelves cannot doubt any more, who is Antichriſt.

                  <hi>Then I looked, and behold there was a Lambe ſtanding:</hi> This Prophecy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at that time, wherein the Dragon being caſt into the earth, drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the woman into the wildernes, chap. 12.13. &amp;c. where more fully the condition of the Church lying hid is declared, in regard of the clearer knowledge of <hi>the ſeventh trumpet,</hi> as hath ben obſerved at the beginning of the 12. chap. The eleventh chapter toucheth the ſtate of former thinges, as it were in one word, ſpending all the reſt of the Prophecy in the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of two witneſſes, as the chiefe members: but here more largely is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded in what ſtate the affaires of the whole body wer in the meane time, both as touching the ſafety, and alſo in reſpect of the fortitude of ſome, by whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct a ioyfull victory is begun. Iohn therefore repeating the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from thence, ſaith, that <hi>he ſawe a Lambe ſtanding on Mount Sion.</hi> Which Lambe is Chriſt, the Sonne of God, as is manifeſt from his correlative in this verſe <hi>his Fathers name.</hi> He playeth the Lambe all this time, patiently ſufferring the <hi>Dragon and the Beaſt,</hi> neither puniſhing them with that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that both he was able, and alſo they had deſerved.

Mount Sion on which the Lambe ſtandeth as on a tower or high hill, is the Church it ſelfe, which ſtandeth firmly like Mount Sion againſt all the force of adverſaries.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>And J heard a voice from Heaven:</hi> from <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> where the Lambe ſtood with this multitude, <hi>from the Temple,</hi> to wit, <hi>from the Church.</hi> The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me thing is ſignifyed by divers names. In this Mountaine onely they did bend themſelves with all their power to praiſe God, the reſt of the world following their wicked, and vaine ſtudies. The voice which was heard, is ſet foorth by a triple ſimilitude, <hi>of waters, thunders,</hi> &amp; <hi>Harpers.</hi> Which three fold ſimilitude noteth the progreſſe of the Church. The firſt voice belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Church declining, <hi>being confuſed, and not diſtinct,</hi> ſuch as is the noiſe of waters: which ſignifyeth nothing, teacheth nothing, but beateth the eares with a certen unprofitable roaring. For when the woman went firſt into the wildernes, although farre moſt learned men flourished in the Church, as Athanaſius, Baſilius, Nazianzene, Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Hie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ronymus, Auguſtine and others, whoſe very learned workes made a great noiſe through the whole world; how notwithſtanding was all this doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in every place not underſtood, not perceived of many men, every one nevertheleſſe earneſtly inclining to their ſuperſtitions? Yea the teachers themſelves did not ſpeake diſtinctly, and plainely, ſometime preaching righteouſnes by Chriſt onely, ſometime attributing the ſame to their own workes: ſometime taking away free will, ſometime leaving the ſame whole: in word condemning Idolatry, in very deede ſtablishing it by the invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saincts, worshipping of reliques, and ſuch wicked ſuperſtitions. Certenly there was ſcarce any point of doctrine, which they did maintaine conſtantly alwayes in the ſame manner. Therefore that was a diſordered noiſe, which rather oppreſſed the ſenſe, then informed the minde with pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable knowledge. For as the wordes of a man giving up the ghoſt, die in his iawes, and make no diſtinct ſounde for the underſtanding of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, ſo the trueth being now readie to die, ſounded ſo confuſedly in the conflict of contrary opinions: that ſcarce any word of it could be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.

                  </gap>t notwithſtanding in this diſordered noiſe, the Saincts learned ſome thing, which avayled to the furthering of their ſalvation. If wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:6819:204"/> this interpretation, which the event maketh good, you may obſerve, what is the judgement of the Spirit concerning the writers of that age, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t pure doctrine can no more be drawen from their writings, then any profitable knowledge be gathered from the noiſe of the daſhing toge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther of waves. I would have nothing taken away from their prayſes: for that which they wanted was long of the time, not of their learning &amp; wit, wherein they excelled. But I cannot but wonder at the daintineſſe of our age, that the good corne being found out, it would feede againe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. The ſecond voice is <hi>of thunder,</hi> roaring, terrible, making a cracking by certaine reſpites. This voice is proper to the Church reviving, uttered by the Waldenſes, the Albingenſes, VVickliefe, and Huſſe. Theſe did thun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der vehemently, and the world was abashed with the great noiſe, but all feare vanished away togither with the roaring, while a newe violent ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d came ſuddenly upon them, as it is in thunder, at which men quake no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then their eares are filled with the noiſe. The voice of <hi>Harpers</hi> belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth evidently to the trueth reſtored, immediately before the <hi>woman</hi> went out of the wilderneſſe, Confeſsions being made of the Churches everie where, the Auguſtane, that of Strasburge, of Baſile, of the Swiſers, of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xonie, moſt ſweetly conſenting all to one trueth. Therefore this threefold voice generally ſetteth before our eyes the whole courſe of the doctrine, from the firſt lurking of the Church, through all that long raigne of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. From which wee ſee, how every latter Prophecy is more cleere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former. Firſt the aſſembly of the faithfull was shewed <hi>by the ſealing,</hi> ch. 7. Afterward by the <hi>covering place in the Temple,</hi> chap. 11. Thirdly, <hi>by the flight into the wilderneſſe,</hi> chap. 12. Now more fully in this manner that wee have heard, and ſhalbe more evident in the particular expoſition.</p>

A new ſong,</hi> is the prayſing of God by Ieſus Chriſt, through whom the elect are made children. It is called <hi>new,</hi> not becauſe men now firſt began, to be, and to be counted the ſonnes of God, but becauſe in the true Chriſtian Church this grace is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to farre moe, then in any place elſe before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of the Redeemer, and confirmed by more plentifull arguments. In which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wee are ſaid <hi>to have received the Spirit of adoption,</hi> Rom. 8.14. not becauſe wee firſt have received it, but becauſe more plentifully then before this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.

But this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell was appointed for the people of the Weſt part: eſpecially Greece alſo being deſtroyed by the deſolation of the Turkes.

That firſt is ſet foorth allegorically in the beginning of the verſe; after it is declared by proper wordes in the other parte. <hi>To drinke of the wine of the wrath,</hi> ſeemeth to be a metaphore made by <hi>antanaclaſis</hi> or reciprocation <hi>unto the wine of fornication:</hi> wherby <hi>idolatry</hi> is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifyed, wherewith men are delighted no leſſe, then with the pleaſantnes of wine. As therefore men reioyce in their ſinnes, ſo God ſhall reioice no leſſe in punishing them: for he shall mixe for them the wine of his wrath, according to that in Deut. 28.63. Or the reaſon may be taken from them that doe kill wicked men by poiſonned drinkes, as once the Athenians, &amp; other people, and at this day the Turkes. But what is this <hi>pure wine mixt?</hi> Theſe thinges ſeeme to be contrary: a thing is ſaid to be mixed, which is powred in for him that shall drinke, although it be not allayed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but that expoſition ſeemeth to mee to be more probable, which will have divers pure wines to be mixed togither; which mixture doth much ſooner cauſe drunkeneſſe, and maketh a greater diſturbance of the body. Water being mingled alayeth the ſtrength of pure wine; which tempering is not fit to ſignify the very great ſeverity of punishement. Let therfore the mixt pure wine be iudgement without mercy to the unrepentant.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ô yee Papiſts conſider diligently, how horrible punishement abideth you, unleſſe you forſake the Pope of Rome. Theſe ſtinging wordes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tin Luther were not of a man, and of an angry adverſary, but which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt miniſtred unto him. Ye ſee that the man was ſent from the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe of Chriſt himſelfe. And thinke not that theſe threates are dead with him, but let your eares ring with the ſame continually. For they live at this day, and shall no leſſe have their force for ever, threatning eternall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to every one who doe yet worship that Romish Idoll. Yea a more grievous punishement is prepared for men, by how much the ungodlines of the Popes chaire is more apparant: let every one heare, who regardeth his eternall ſalvation.</p>

For to the ende that the Saincts should be more pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to undergoe danger, it is avouched from heaven, that <hi>the utmoſt trouble which the wicked can bring upon the faithfull, is preſent happines to them:</hi> and that it shall not be in vaine, although it ſeemeth otherwiſe to the world, that they doe throwe themſelves into ſo great perils for the trueths ſake: for their workes should follow them, of which they should receive ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a moſt ſweete fruit, and obtaine at length a moſt bleſſed and ample re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward. Neither is it without cauſe, that there is ſo expreſſe mention of the time, <hi>from this time,</hi> from <hi>now,</hi> that I may ſo ſay: the common tranſlation hath, <hi>from now.</hi> Theod.

As long as they had to doe with the Heathen perſecuting Chriſt in his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bers profeſſedly, no man could doubt, but that he ought to ſpend his life in that cauſe. But in the combate with them who boaſted that they alone were true Chriſtians, iuſtly the more ſimple might doubt, whether they should reſiſt unto blood. Therefore to the ende that the Spirit might take away this ſcruple, and that the faithfull should not doubt to die in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flict, <hi>he pronounceth them happy who die from hencefoorth,</hi> as though he should ſay, a crowne of celeſtiall glory doth remaine no leſſe for all thoſe who die in the fight againſt the Beaſt, then for thoſe who for Chriſts ſake were ſlai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne before time by the Heathens; wordes full of confort. And ſo indeede it came to paſſe in the Church reſtored after the yeere 1543, after the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Aquen, againſt them of Merindoll and Cabriers, &amp; many others having ſufferred calamities in Fraunce: when a rumour alſo was ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, of the entrepriſes of the Emperour, and of the Pope againſt religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for then many weake brethren being amazed at the dangers preſent and expected, began to thinke by diſſembling their religion, to provide for their goods and life. Which thing feare perſuaded them to be lawfull by the example of Nicodemus.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:6819:210"/> on the cloude to the labour, both by the faculty given him of God, and alſo by the opportune ripeneſſe of the corne. <hi>Hereupon he biddeth him to put in his ſickle, and reape.</hi> For now <hi>the time to reape is come.</hi> The thing being atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted before, obtained no ioyfull iſſue, becauſe yet the time was not fitte; but now God would proſper their godly endevours. It is to be obſerved, ſeeing that this Angell commeth out of <hi>the inner temple,</hi> not the exteriour court (which partition was made in the eleventh chapter) that the Spirit is yet employed in a more full declaration of the ſame time, to wit, of the Church lying hid, and shut up in a narrow place, as wee have shewed at the firſt verſe of this chapter.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>Then he that ſate on the cloude thruſt in his ſickle on the earth:</hi> The thing is put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and wanteth not ſucceſſe, the corne falling of his owne accord before the ſickle through the great ripeneſſe of it. The word <hi>earth</hi> was taken before commonly in the worſe part. In which ſignification it may note that thoſe, who before were <hi>inhabitans of the earth,</hi> that is, mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>of the earthly Church,</hi> which is very farre off from the true and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shalbe gathered now at length into the bundels of the more pure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in this harveſt; or if the harveſt be onely of the reprobate, ſo as that theſe alone are cut downe with the ſickle: the meaning of the viſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the ſame ende, but that former ſenſe is more naturall. For it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that at length there should ariſe confortable Princes and Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, who by the perſuaſion and exhortation of godly Miniſters, should ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther from Antichriſtian ſuperſtition, their ſubiects into the true Church, and the ſyncere profeſsion of wholeſome doctrine, but should drive away the contrary impiety and the practiſers thereof out of their coaſts. Such white cloudes were Saxonie, Miſnia, Haſsia, Pruſsia, the free cities, Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burge, Zurich, Berne, Geneve, Baſill &amp;c. They that ſate on theſe cloudes were Frederike of Saxonie, Mauritius, Philip the Lantgrave, Ioachimus of Brunſwike, Albert of Brandeburg Princes. The Senate of Zuriche, of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purge, of Berna, of Geneva, and the reſt. The Angel comming out of the Temple, is Iuſtus Ionas, Philip Melancthon, Nicolas Amſtorfius, Iohn Dulcius, which wer perſuaders of Frederik Duke of Saxonie for to abroga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te the private Maſſe, and to beginne reformation. Likewiſe Zuinglius, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. Capito, Blaverus, and the other holy men in their places. <hi>The ſickle put on the earth,</hi> are the handes of Princes and Senatours of cities, put foorth for the amending of corruptions: to wit, when the Maſſe was abrogated at Wittenberg, in the yeere 1521. the Idoles, Images, and Altars being ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken away out of the whole dominion of the Tigurines, in the yeer 1523: and more over a few yeeres after when there came a more perfit reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:6819:210"/> the day and yeere of ſuperſtition aboliſhed, were written on pillars with letters of Golde. When in all the places above rehearſed the reapers did bend to the worke ſtoutly, ſtriving who might doe beſt in cutting downe wicked ſuperſtition, and in pulling up darnell by the rootes, for which before, they were not able to ſee the corne, they did ſo beare ſway in the whole fielde. This harveſt was begun about the yeere 1521, &amp; was hotely applyed by the ſpace of tenne whole yeeres next after and more: it folowed Luther by and by, who a little before the reformation was begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thought it needfull for feare of the Emperours proſcription, to hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a more ſecret place. While he then lay hid, an other Angel tooke this office upon him to exhorte him that ſate upon the cloude, to thruſt in his ſickle on the earth, by taking away Idolatry, and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the godly as handfuls into holy aſſemblies, as hath bene declared. Neither is this an alluſion like to be true, but ſuch an application as the regard of the time requireth neceſſarily. The Church lay hid yet in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as is manifeſt by the Angels, which come out from thence. But about the ende of the limited time of a thouſand two hondreth and threeſcore yeeres should be the harveſt &amp; vintage following; to which moreover the laſt place is given in this Prophecy, becauſe after all the former thinges were finished, theſe alſo should be performed in their time. And all theſe thinges moſt fitly agree to that application, which I have brought: neither shall any by ſearching out finde either any other Angel, or harveſt alſo, that every thinke may agree neceſſarily with themſelves.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>And an other Angel.</hi> So was the harveſt, the vintage followeth as it is wonte. But this is proper to the <hi>wicked,</hi> as that was to the godly. For the Saincts are well compared to wheate and corne, the profitableſt thinges, and moſt neceſſary thinges: which by the ſolidneſſe of their fruite, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fitly the ſoundneſſe of good men, who are more profitable for their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, then goodly in outward shew. But the full, and ſwelling dainties of grapes doe moſt aptly declare the preſent felicity of the wicked. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt belonged to Germany, and brought us to the yeere 1520: this vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is proper to our England, ſo wonderfully agreeing to the things here done, both in the courſe of time, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of all the matter, that it is not to be doubted, but that the Spirit pointed with the finger to theſe grapes. Which that we may perceive more eaſily, every thing is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. There is both a <hi>preparation</hi> &amp; alſo an <hi>execution</hi> of this <hi>vintage.</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to 2 Angels ver. 17.18. ioined togither in labour, as thoſe in the harveſt, which in like ſort doe thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der with a double craſh. The executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is done firſt by <hi>pruning the vine, &amp; caſting the cluſters of grapes into the wine preſſe,</hi> v. 19. after <hi>by treading the wine preſſe,</hi> v. 20.</p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:6819:211"/>
               <p>The ſhredders are two Angels companions, converſant <hi>in the ſame Temple,</hi> that is, both free citizens of the true Church yet lying hid. For it was not yet freed from her narrow ſtraights, although the Gentiles in the meane time reigned in a great aſſembly in the court, and holy city. Which is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be obſerved, ſeeing the place of the Angels manifeſteth alſo the time when the thinge was done, and as it were beareth a candle before us, to put away darkeneſſe. Touching the firſt Angel mention is made parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in this verſe, that <hi>he had a ſharpe ſickle,</hi> that is, power to cut off the cluſters of grapes, and to prune the vine, in which thing he should carry himſelfe couragiouſly, as <hi>the ſharpe ſickle</hi> declareth. But he neither ſitteth on a cloude, neither hath a crowne on his head, as <hi>the Angel of the harveſt,</hi> ver. 14. Whether are theſe thinges ſet downe once in common, to be tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſferred hither? Or whether rather this Angel doth not attaine that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of dignity in which the former was: but that it is of a ſomewhat low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er claſſe and degree?, So it ſeemeth, ſeeing it is not a ſafe thinge to adde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the wordes inſpired of God, but upon moſt certain reaſon. Therefore this Angel is <hi>Thomas Cromwell,</hi> in the dayes of K. Henry the eight moſt mighty Prince, a man with us moſt famous, Earle of Eſſex, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Great Seale: who <hi>came out of the Temple,</hi> which is in heaven, a ſyncere favourer of pure religion. He had <hi>a ſickle,</hi> being appointed the K. deputy in matters Eccleſiaſticall, did apply the ſame sharply and luſtily to the worke: yet not endued with any either crowne or diademe, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a miniſter of anothers power, then an authour of his owne.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>And an other Angel came out of the Altar:</hi> The ſecond Angel is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a threefold property, that <hi>he commeth out of the Altar,</hi> that <hi>he hath power over fire,</hi> and that <hi>he exhorteth his fellow Angel to cut the vine.</hi> Touching the firſt, it is ſaid ſignificantly <hi>to come out of the Altar.</hi> For ſo the Greeke hath <hi>out of the Altar.</hi> Theod.

A man commeth from a thing, nigh to which he was: but out of a thinge, within the compaſſe whereof he was contained. But how can he come out of the Altar? This may be un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtood from chap. 6.9. <hi>I ſaw,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>under the Altar the ſoules of them, which had bin killed.</hi> This kinde then of ſpeaking declareth that this Angel is an holy Martyr, ſuch as they are who have a place under the Altar. But they that lye under the Altar, muſt needs come out of the ſame, when they goe any whither. But whereas there are many kindes of Martyrdome (for ſome are conſumed by ſword, ſome by an halter, ſome by wilde beaſts, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome by fire) that it may be underſtood of what ſort this Martyr is; it is added, <hi>that he hath power over fire,</hi> that is to ſay, that he ſufferring and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:6819:211"/> the torment of fire (for this is <hi>to have power over fire</hi>) he gave te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the trueth. But that in the third place <hi>he crieth to him that hath a ſickle,</hi> it is taught that this Martyr is deſcribed to be ſuch an one, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the future combate, then paſſed victory. For a Martyr that is dead cannot exhorte to any excellent great act. The example of his conſtancy, may ſtirre up the minde to the like courage: but it is not granted him to inſtruct by word unto any peculiar actions, as this of pruning the vine is, unleſſe he were living togither with us. This exhortation therefore puts us in minde, that Martyrdome was at length to be endured of him, not that he had ſufferred it before, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he exhorted to theſe things. All which circunſtances ioyned togither, lead us unto <hi>Thomas Cranmer Archbiſhop</hi> (as they call him) <hi>once of Canterbury.</hi> This was a notable Martyr, having power over fire, to which he gave his body to be burned for the trueth. Whoſe power over fire was ſo much the more famous, becauſe firſt having fallen by humane infirmity, in ſubſcribing to a wicked opinion, repenting by and by, and revoking his ſubſcription, when he was brought to the fire, he would have his right hande firſt to endure the burning flame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it had ben ſo ready an inſtrument of wickednes, which being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at length, he gave his body to be devoured in the ſame flames. <hi>He cryeth with a loude cry to him that had the ſickle,</hi> becauſe in the time of King Henry the eight he ſtirred up Thomas Cromwell by his wordes to make this grapes gathering. For being excellently learned, and burning with an ardent zeale, he could not but haſten forward the worke to his power, &amp; inflame him, whom he ſaw to be endued with the power to doe it.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Then the Angel thruſt in his ſickle.</hi> Thus farre the preparation, now the execution is accomplished in cutting downe the grapes of the vineyard. Which Vine is the ſhining and Princely glory of the Popiſh Church: the felicity whereof was great among us in time paſt, even as in every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it ſwelled with full and redde grapes, it hung on railes aloft &amp; made faſt togither, overshadowing the whole earth on every ſide with large branches, and thicke cluſters of grapes. For it is knowne (the rubbiſh doe yet teſtify) how all fruitfull hilles were planted with theſe wilde vines all our Iland through, how deepe rootes they tooke, &amp; with how farre ſpread branches, they did ſo ſtoppe up the Sunne, that it could no where ſhine on the corne. But when it pleaſed God at length to punish this wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he raiſed up Henry the VIII, who for iuſt cauſes being angry with the Pope both shooke of from himſelfe the Antichriſtian yoke, &amp; alſo tooke it from the neckes of his people. Neither content with this miniſtery of the Angels, partly <hi>of Cromwell with his ſharpe ſickle,</hi> partly <hi>of Cranmer having
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:6819:212"/> power over fire:</hi> In the yeere 1539. he laboured that this whole vine should be not ſo much cut, as plucked up by the rootes and utterly deſtroyed. For hence the Abbeys and Fryeries were pulled downe, the Nunries layed eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ground, and the landes and revenues of olde appointed to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſuperſtitions, were brought againe to the common treaſure, and at length being ſet forth to a publike ſale, they were ſolde to divers perſons. And this is the cutting of the cluſters of grapes, and the caſting of them into the wine preſſe, a thing indeede memorable, if wee ſhall conſider it di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligently, according to the nobleneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>And the wine preſſe was troden without the city:</hi> This city is the holy Church of God, which the Scriptures doe note often times by the name of a city, beyond the territories of which, this preſſe was troden; how wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully doth this agree? For howſoever England ſpoyled the Papiſts of their goods and riches, and according to their demerits put them from al their dignity; yet nevertheleſſe shee had not as yet attayned for that time ſuch reformation, for which rightly it could be called a wholy city. The Pope was banished, but the Papiſme was retained, as is manifeſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe ſixe articles made the next yeere after that the Monaſteries were broken downe. Wherein it was thus ordained: <hi>That under the forme of bread &amp; wine there is the true and naturall body and blood of Chriſt, and that after the conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſubſtance of bread and wine remaineth no longer. That the receiving of the whole ſupper of the Lord, is not neceſſary to ſalvation, and that under whether of the formes you will, whole Chriſt is contained. That it is not lawfull for Prieſts to marry. That the vowes of chaſtety are to be kept. That private Maſſes are to be retained. That auricular and ſecret confeſſion of ſinnes is profitable and neceſſary.</hi> Theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes defiled Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that it could not be the dwelling place of God at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And blood came out of the wine preſſe:</hi> Blood by an elegant metaphore is the juyce of grapes; but it commeth neerer to the iuyce of theſe who are now ſpoken of by a certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> property of ſpeech. For it is that calamity which came of the overthrowe of the Pope, which was ſo great, that not onely the whole countrey was moiſt therewith, but alſo it overflowed to the hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes bridles. Wee have heard that they, to whom this buſineſſe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of deſtroying the dennes and to confiſcate the goods, riding with a great traine, viſited almoſt all the houſes through the whole countrey: which office while they execute, ſo great havock was made of the Papiſts riches, that horſes might ſeeme to ſwime in their ſpoyles, as it were in a deepe river of preſſed grapes. But beſide this, I ſuppoſe an other greater thing to be ſignifyed, to wit, that not onely the common ſorte of men,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:6819:212"/> who were no leſſe cheerefull to execute this buſines, then horſes are to the battell, became greatly enriched and increaſed by theſe meanes; but alſo the Noble men themſelves and Peeres of the Realme, who are as it were the raines to governe the common people, made alſo very great gaine thereof. It is knowne well inough that the beginning of many mens No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility came from hence, and other mens farre greater abundance. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ther ſcarce any, at leaſt of any value and reckening, <hi>who went not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey wood when this oke did fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ By the ſpace of a thouſand and ſixe hundreth furlongs:</hi> That is, through the whole countrey of England A thouſand ſixe hundreth furlonges, make two hundreth English miles. But the length of the countrey from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of the South to the fartheſt ende of the North part is more by an hundreth miles: but if wee shall take away the Northen waſt ground, where the countrey nigh the boundes is deſert and unhusbanded (which theſe grapes, that is, religious nation dreaded greatly, as too colde an ayre, delighting in the Sunnie and moſt pleaſant places) wee ſee alſo a mervai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſent even in this parte. In this wiſe therefore is the vintage of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, ſo manifeſtly declared by the agreement of all thinges, that it is not to be doubted, but that this alone is the naturall application of this type. And nowe wee perceive, with what ſingular skilfulnes the Spirit hath deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all memorable thinges, which should come to paſſe in the Church, even till the yeere 1556. In this chapter he ſtayeth at the yeere 1540. but the eleventh chapter hath ſupplyed that which is wanting here ſince that time. The thirteene Centuries deſcribe moſt cleerely even to the yeere thirteene hundred, the acts of the Dragon and of the Beaſt. From thence our countrey man Iohn Foxe beginning at Weckliefe, with whom you may ioyne Iohn Sleidane and Gaſpar Peucer, followeth on the thinges re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayning, even to the <hi>ſeventh trumpet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe of this their more aboundant and greater knowledge of things paſt, which the diligence of theſe should bring to men under the <hi>blowing of the ſeventh trumpet,</hi> the Spirit hath made this repetition now agreeing with their narrations.</p>
               <p>The whole Prophecy of theſe three chapters is from the time of Iohn unto the yeere one thouſand five hundreth and fourty, that is, of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foure hundreth fifty yeeres.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>And I ſaw an other ſigne:</hi> Theſe wordes are uſed in ſted of a paſſage to an other matter; wherby, this propheſie following, is diſtinguished from that which was erſt explayned in the three former chapters. And now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth the third and laſt <hi>period,</hi> divided from the former, by the kind of <hi>events,</hi> which therfore have a new inſtrument, of <hi>vials:</hi> but yet agreing with them, in as much as it is a part of the <hi>ſeventh trumpet,</hi> as may eaſily appear by the things ſpoken before. For the <hi>Tabernacle in heaven,</hi> is not <hi>opened</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>ſeventh trumpet;</hi> chap. 11.15.19. But the Miniſters of this work, which have charge given them to power out the vials, doo come out of <hi>the Temple opened in heaven;</hi> as after in the 5. and 6. verſes of this chapter. Moreover, the Angel foretold that <hi>the ende ſhould come,</hi> when the ſeventh trumpet ſounded; chap. 10.7. Now theſe ſeven vials, doe bring the <hi>end</hi> with them; their Miniſters being ſayd, in this verſe, to have <hi>the ſeven laſt pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gues;</hi> and therfore they neceſſarily belong to that <hi>trompet.</hi> For if the firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, anſwered to the firſt trompet, and then the reſt in order, ſo as every one should be of the ſame time that the tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet is, wherewith it is ioyned: there were no reaſon why they should be called the <hi>laſt plagues.</hi> But the thing is not ſo: eſpecially ſeing the firſt vial, brings evil on the men, which were branded with the <hi>Beaſts mark;</hi> chap. 16.1. which mark we have ſeen to be the invention not of the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> but of the <hi>ſecond,</hi> chap. 13.16. whoſe birth days fell out under the <hi>fift trompet.</hi> Wheras by this reaſon, the <hi>mark</hi> should neceſſarily goe before al the trompets; the firſt whereof, should not ſo much imprint the mark it ſelfe, as afflict the men on whom it was already printed. Moreover, the Saincts <hi>triumphe</hi> is ſung in this chapter, for the <hi>victory gotten of the Beaſt,</hi> before the vials are powred out, or the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels take their work in hand; ver. 2. &amp;c. But the Beaſt dyeth not under the <hi>firſt trompet,</hi> but is then born, and from thence forth, flouriſheth until the <hi>harveſt</hi> and <hi>vintage;</hi> chap. 14. and the <hi>two Prophets riſe up from the dead;</hi> chap. 11.11. which things fel out about the end of the <hi>ſixt trompet,</hi> as we have shewed. Yea but there is a great ſimilitude, between the <hi>trompets</hi> &amp; the <hi>vials;</hi> there is in deed; but to this ende onely, that we may know how <hi>men ar puniſhed, in the ſame degrees and ſteps that they have ſinned.</hi> Yet they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:6819:214"/> both in <hi>time,</hi> and in <hi>manner of puniſhment:</hi> for the <hi>vials</hi> are onely <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> wheras the <hi>trompets</hi> be <hi>offenſes.</hi> It is therfore manifeſt, that the whole diſtance of time, from Iohn, to the coming of our Lord, is divided into <hi>three periods;</hi> and every of them agayn, into ſeven more particular ſeaſons, or <hi>articles;</hi> ſo, as under the laſt of that which went before, beginneth the firſt of that which foloweth; that is to ſay, as from the <hi>laſt ſeal,</hi> doo ariſe the <hi>ſeven tronpets;</hi> ſo from the <hi>laſt trompet,</hi> doo ariſe the <hi>ſeven vials.</hi> Which diſtribution of the time, maketh this propheſie eaſy unto us; which ells would be very intricate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ In heaven:</hi> That is, in the purer Church. For as of olde, the Lord was wont <hi>to rore out of Sion, and give his voice out of Ieruſalem,</hi> Amos, 1.2. ſo the evil by which al his enemies now shall utterly perish, shal come out of his holy Church, wherin he wil shew himſelfe an avenger, in punishing al the reprobats. And <hi>great and marvelous</hi> is this <hi>ſigne,</hi> becauſe of the wonderful change of the courſe of things, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi> being overcome and abolished, and th'eternal happines of the <hi>Church</hi> procured; as we shal ſee in the things particularly to be handled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Seven Angels:</hi> According to the manner of the former periods. Theſe be men, citizens of the purer Church; as appeareth by the <hi>place</hi> from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce they come; and their <hi>attire:</hi> of which hereafter. Theod.

They are ſayd to have, the <hi>ſeven laſt plagues;</hi> becauſe when theſe are doon, ther shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be happy times onely, until the end of al things be come: as the next words shew. For they are not caled <hi>the laſt,</hi> as if they should come a little before the ende: but becauſe by them Gods wrath shalbe fulfilled, in abo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lishing the enemies and tempeſts of the Church. They have their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning togither with the <hi>ſeventh trompet,</hi> about the yere 1560. in reſpect of which, we ſay they <hi>are to come,</hi> and not in reſpect of this time onely, wherin we now live.

For, in ſted of that <hi>Cryſtal,</hi> here <hi>fire</hi> is mingled: <hi>a glaſſy ſea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>mixt with fire.</hi> That therfore, was clear as glaſſe; and moſt ſimple, without al colour, as Cryſtal is: this alſo is clear as glaſſ; but coloured with fyrie rednes; not shining with the ſimplicity of Cryſtall. And what other thing doth fyre ſignify, than fervent ſtrifes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, burning with hatred? <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth,</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>and what is my deſire, if it be already kindled?</hi> Luk 12.49. This inſeparable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, muſt the heavenly truth of the laſt <hi>period,</hi> have ioyned with it: the doctrine should be <hi>glaſſy</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> through which we may behold the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious countenance of the Father in Chriſt Ieſus; yet not in al reſpects pure as <hi>Cryſtal,</hi> but coloured with the <hi>fyre</hi> of contention. Which thing verily, all godly men to their great greif, doo find at this day too true. That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtrife about <hi>ſacramental ſignes,</hi> how great ſturres wrought it in the Church? which yet had not ynough it ſelfe alone to trouble all things: but it muſt bring forth alſo (as an evil bird an evil egg) that unheard monſter of <hi>Vbiquitie.</hi> The ſparks hereof were caſt into the <hi>ſea,</hi> by Luther himſelfe; but quenched agayn, both by his own modeſty and godlines, and by Melanch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tons &amp; others that have wel deſerved of the Church. Til afterwards Iohn Brentius, and Iames Andrewes, about the year 1561. did again with much payns as with bellowes, ſtyrr up the flame. Neyther was the conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion about theſe cheif points onely; but about <hi>Gods grace, Predeſtination, Baptiſme,</hi> and other things alſo: as errour for the moſt part never goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without ſome company. The Churches which are further off from the brenn of this <hi>fyre,</hi> doo burn with an other no leſſe fervent flame of <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bition:</hi> wherupon have ariſen very sharp contention for dignities and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as for neceſſary ornaments of the Church; though purer times doe ſufficiently teach, that nothing ever brought more certayn deſtruction therunto. Neither doth ambition ſuffer, ſo free a preaching of the word, as should be: nor manners to be reſtreyned with that bridle, which being taken away, a liberty foloweth to al manner wickednes, or ſuch at leaſt, as abolisheth Chriſtian pietie. This kinde of <hi>fyre,</hi> raungeth throughout the whole renewed Church; and eyther conſumeth many, or moleſteth the reſt; whiles they labour to quench it. Neither is ther ſound quietnes in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place; this wild-fyre living even in midds of the waters.

In like manner they that <hi>get victorie of the Beaſt,</hi> are ſuch as prevayl againſt him, his image, mark, and number of his name. Theſe al are ſet downe ſeverally, for that the victory should be ful and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute: though the Beaſt remayn yet a litle while. For they should not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely reject <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelfe, but abhorre alſo al his <hi>mark,</hi> yea and not ſuffer themſelves to be called by <hi>the number of his name.</hi> VVe have shewed, that <hi>the number of his name,</hi> which is, to be called a <hi>Latine,</hi> is the leaſt bond of ſociety, wherewith men are tyed to Antichriſt: which was proper to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who by admitting this ſymbol, obteyned mutual trafique. But the inhabitans of the VVeſt, which long agoe eaſily ſufferred themſelves to be made his marked ſoldjers, and to be called <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and of the Popes reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; doo now deteſt the very name <hi>Latine,</hi> which the Greeks ſo hardly &amp; lately received. This victory therfore is full, as is ſignifyed by this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reherſal of <hi>Image, mark,</hi> &amp; <hi>number of name.</hi> But, thou wilt ſay, when fell out this victory?

The yere next after, they trode down the Beaſt in Scotland. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe times the truth did fight, but in doubtfull battel: now it did plainly beat down and overthrow the enemies. Vnto theſe, many other are to be added, as in France, Sweveland, Denmark, Suecia, Pruſsia; al which being joyned togither, doo make up this company, that ſtand at the <hi>glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſea.</hi>

Seing therfore wee all whom God hath freed from Antichriſts tyranny, doo yet ſtand on the brink, newly eſcaped out of danger: what evil fury vexeth us, that wee should rave, brethren againſt brethren, with al kinde of reproches, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and contumelies? How shamefull, yea how wicked a thing would it have bin, if the Iſraelites for whoſe ſake the waters were cleft aſunder; and whiles they eſcaped by a paſſage unheard off, through the midds of the ſea, ſo ſoon as they came ſafe to the shore, their enemies were drowned: if they, I ſay, should have ſtuck and killed one an other? Yet this ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prank doo we play at this day.

Perhaps this is the righter. But both of them doe ſignify alike, the great pleaſure that is felt by this victory; ſuch as we have shewed was in the Tigu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rines, who <hi>wrote upon a pillar with letters of Golde, the year and day when reforma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion began</hi> among them. With what precious ſtone should this day be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, of much fuller victory and triumph? But we are in ſpecial to reſpect the <hi>Confeſsions</hi> ſet forth in this time: for theſe are moſt ſweet harps, &amp; that of God; whoſe ſtrings he hath tuned, and with whoſe melody he is much delited. Whiles the Temple was shutt, the voice of the Harpers ſounded with ſweet harmonie, when the Churches teſtifyed their conſent of doctri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, by the writings published and offred to Ceſar; as we have shewed on chap. 14.2. But now after the yere 1558. a much ſweeter ſymphonie is

For this deliverance out of the jawes of Antichriſt, is of no leſſe power and good will of God towards his, then was that from Pharaoh. No marvel if the ſame benefit, be celebrated with the ſame ſong.

Moreover, that which is here ſayd, <hi>the temple of the tabernacle of teſtimony was opened:</hi> is the ſame in effect with this, <hi>&amp; the Ark of his covenant was ſeen in his temple,</hi> chap. 11.29.</p>

This ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore is no ſufficient cauſe. But there two ſeem to be ioyned togither, for to shew that this <hi>Temple</hi> was yet a pilgrim, and the <hi>Angels</hi> that came out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, were burgeſſes of the militant Church. But ſome man may ſay, if they <hi>come forth out of the Temple,</hi> it may ſeem the Church is yet in ſecret: by which argument, we have ſerched out the time of the former Propheſie, chap. 14.15.

For they are the garments of Aarons ſonnes, Exod. 28.42. And all the elect are made Preiſts. Al the faithfull now doo dwel in the Temple, wherinto of olde none might come but the Levites.

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And no man was able to enter into the Temple:</hi> This sheweth the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reſt, what it should be in the mean time, while theſe plagues cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed down the enemies. To weet, they should remayn without the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not able to enter in for ſmoke, as <hi>Moſes could not enter into the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the congregation, whiles the cloud was upon it,</hi> Evod. 40.35. Alike ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in ſome ſorte, shalbe the condition of the Church when it is reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as it was when it lay hidd. As long as <hi>the Temple was ſhutt,</hi> &amp; the ſaincts
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:6819:218"/> 
                  <hi>pitched their camp in mount Sion,</hi> the Lamb being their Captayn: <hi>no man could learn the ſong which they ſang:</hi> chap. 14.3. It belonged to a few elect; into whoſe number, none of the reſt of the world, could joyne himſelfe. Even ſo, when the Temple is opened, although the Church be much more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and conſpicuous, yet shal not al betake them ſelves unto the boſome therof, until the <hi>ſeven plagues</hi> be fulfilled. Which is firſt to be underſtood of the Iewes; whoſe ful caling shal not be, until the <hi>vials</hi> be <hi>poured out.</hi> Ful, I ſay; becauſe during the plagues, ther shalbe ſome beginning, but not an abſolute perfection, before they be altogither paſt. For, Rome drives the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from entring in; which when it shalbe taken away, then the Iewes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations many, al impediments being removed, shal flow even with ſtrift unto the Church, and shal thenceforth continue the faithful nouriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame. For we ſee that al ar not by this ſmoke quite shut out of the Temple. Seven Angels come out from thence; which should not come forth, but to execute their office: wherupon the reſt of the Saincts, abide therein. This ſmoke therfore, hindred not al the elect of the Gentils from entring in: but the Iewes, and ful number of the Gentiles onely.</p>

The difference is, that the voice from the <hi>Throne,</hi> cometh as it were immediately from God: from the <hi>Temple,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing is obteyned by the prayers of the ſaincts: who here are ſayd to command; that we may know how great force faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prayers have; which as if they were <hi>authors</hi> of the thing to be doon, doe ſo boldly bid the matter to be taken in hand. And in deed, it could not be, that men inlightned with ſo great light of the truth, should not earneſtly ſtrive with God in prayer, to deſtroy Antichriſt very ſpeedily.

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:6819:221"/> by his Bulls againſt our moſt noble Queen, ſeverely commanding all ſubjects to forſake their allegeance unto their Prince: neyther could they be ſtayed by any religious regard of oath, wherof that violatour of al Law both of God and man, did diſcharge them. But, thanks be to God, he yet laboured in vayn, wherby his torment is much the more increaſt. For thus ſayd he with himſelfe, as Saul did of old; <hi>Have ye al conſpired againſt me? Js ther none of you that is ſory for my ſake?</hi> Wil no man eaſe my boyle, with the blood of that Queen, which hath wrought me ſo much woe? Have pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tience, good Pope; this is the time of thine ulcer, not of thine eaſe. But his ſicknes ſuffreth him not to reſt. Therfore he rageth felly, with venemous libells; he incenſeth the Kings with al earneſtnes, to wage warr; he privily ſendeth Ieſuits, the bellowes of al ſeditions, to betray their country; he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſuborneth ungracious cut-throats, to kil their ſacred Prince: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he applyes himſelfe by whatſoever means he can, to ſtyrr up troubles, wherby he may work the utter deſtruction of the realm, and of us all. But having tryed all wayes in vayn, through the mercy and goodnes of our God, theſe two and fourty yeres; both he the Prince and head of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefs, and his deſperate children, <hi>doo ſcarce refrayn from tears, becauſe they nought worth tears doo ſee.</hi> In France about the ſame time, (that we may ſee this ſoare was univerſally ſpred among the Papiſts;) when Charles the 9. began his reign, and dayly the Papiſts authority did more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay: a great part of Nobility, joyned themſelves to the purer doctrine, of the Peers of the realm very many; the Queen mother (for fear, I ſuppoſe, of her Engliſh neighbour,) was much buſied about religion, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely favoured the profeſſours therof, or at leaſt feigned it; ſome of the Papiſts we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t more ſeldom to their wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted temples; many which ſtuck more faſt to their old opinions, kept themſelves ſo within their private wall, that they durſt ſcarce be ſeen in publik meetings For what other diſeaſe, I pray; then for the payn of this ulcer? Germany had angred the Thracian ſtock, long before. But at the ſame time, the wounds erſt inflicted, now growing more full of atter, were changed into ulcers. The decree of Charles, as we ſayd before, was heavy, wherin peace and liberty was granted to religion; but the leſſe hope they had to repele the ſame, the ſharper did it prick the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dayly. For Emperour Ferdinandus ſucceeding his brother, thought it beſt to reſt in the former decrees, wherto he had conſented at Auguſta, before he was Emperour. Maximilian his ſon, did alwayes miſlike that manner of propagating Chriſtian religion, with armes, or compelling any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, that were unwilling. How untollerable was this moderation to the ulcerous Papiſts, that burned with deſire of revenge? But now let us
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:6819:221"/> ſee in a word, how this ulcer wil not be touched. Which the Council of Trent verily shewed, in the ſecond ſeſsion under Pius 4. in the yere 1562. where this buſines was committed to ſome choſen men, for to conſider of divers cenſures and books, eyther ſuſpected or pernicious: that is, that by al meanes they should have care ther went out nothing among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that nipped the Popes authority, and Romiſh ſuperſtition in any one word. Doubtleſſe the ulcer is very egre and virulent, that can indure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is rough or hard. Therfore whatſoever is layd to it, let it be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſoft. For this cauſe did Pius the 4. ſet forth an Index of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden books; which Sixtus the 5. afterwards augmented, and Clemens the 8. lately recognized. VVherin it is appointed, which books men muſt quite abſteyn from; and which one may uſe, ſo they be corrected. (Certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the Pope preſcribes a diet, for his botchie patients.) Among other ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of correcting, this is one, <hi>that al things be wel lookt to, and attentively noted, not onely the things that offer themſelves manifeſtly in the courſe of the work: but if ther be any that ſecretly doo lurk in the Scholies, in the ſummaries, in the margins, in the tables of the books, in the prefaces or epiſtles dedicatorie.</hi> Inſtruct. de correct. book D. 2. How ſuſpicious is ſicknes? Verily this fear of running upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that may offend, hath shred off in many late writers whatſoever was in them of ſoundeſt iudgment, and more free truth. But the bookes are in al mens hands, wherby they may perceive, what it is that payneth theſe brand-marked perſons, and where. Although one purging Index ſet forth by Philip the 2. King of Spain, in the year 1571. may be in ſted of many And leaſt thou mighteſt think perhaps, that they are troubled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning late writers onely, or the marginal notes of others: they doo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the very words of the ancient Fathers. For example, in a certaine edition of Auguſtine, which Iohn Gibbon an Engliſh Ieſuite, Doctor of Div. &amp; Profeſſor at Trevers, peruſed in the diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about Saincts, Theſ. 207. there theſe words are no more read, <hi>yet doo not we conſtitute temples, preiſthoods, holy things and ſacrifices to the Martyrs &amp;c.</hi> as the ancient true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies have, in the 8. book <hi>of the City of God,</hi> chap 17. but contrary thus; <hi>we doo conſtitute temples, preiſthoods, holy things and ſacrifices to the Martyrs, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe not they but their God is our God &amp;c.</hi> O impudent falſers, which make Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine to affirm, that, which he openly denyeth: that I ſpeake not how unapt you feyghn his words to be, that ſacrifices are to be conſtituted to the Martyrs, becauſe they are not God. The Ratts doo periſh by their own bewraying. Francis Iunius in the yeere 1559, ſaw at Lions with Trelloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſome pages of the true Ambroſe cancelled and raſed by two Franciſcan Friers, and other new ones ſubſtituted in place of the former, after their
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:6819:222"/> own wil, againſt all faithful evidence of other books. An unhoneſt prank, and an impious: but not new with the Romiſts; who shewed themſelves ſuch artizens long ſince, in the Council of Nice. But what doo they mean, by adulterating the writings of the ancients? Would they ſtop the mouth of this age? They cannot: ther are left, thanks be to God, true copies, by which their ſacrilegious impudency is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinced. Or, as is more likely, doo they provide for time to come? Foolish Popelings, which now get ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writers to ſuccour you: when ſhortly ther shal not a Papiſt be left for them to yeild ſuccour unto. Your cauſe, within theſe few yeres, shalbe tried, not by the Fathers, but by fyre and ſword: as this Revelation wil manifeſt. In the mean while we may obſerve, both how da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous it is, to depend now on the Fathers imprinted by others: and how ful of botches the Popish crew is, which is ſo afrayd of nayles, as it pareth them to the quick; &amp; not herewith content, wrappeth woll alſo about the Fathers fingers, that they may the ſoftlyer handle their ſcabby bodyes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And the ſecond Angel powred out his vial upon the Sea:</hi> The ſecond vial puts forth his force againſt the <hi>ſea;</hi> to weet, figurative, as was the <hi>earth:</hi> for ther is the ſame reſpect doubtleſſe of every one. And ſeing the overthrow of Antichriſt is here in hand, what great dammage should he ſuffer, more then al other men, by the ſea properly ſo caled, turned into rotten blood? For this is the firſt effect of this vial: neither would the ſecond hurt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit more, wherby <hi>al living things dye in this ſea.</hi> The <hi>earth</hi> affordeth him infinite daynties, ſo that he may eaſily bear the want of fiſhes, though they should dye every one. Wherfore we muſt not ſtick in the native ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but take that which we have ſeen often uſed before. It meaneth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the notable change wherof, should fall out under this <hi>vial;</hi> of corrupt, being made moſt corrupt. In former ages verily it was <hi>turned into bloud:</hi> but now it changeth into much more groſſe and royled filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then ever before: until at length it becometh like the <hi>bloud of a dead man,</hi> that is, rotten, clammy, groſſe, black bloud; not liquid and freſh, ſuch as floweth from a living body. The firſt Council of Trent therfore, is this <hi>ſea;</hi> being no leſſe conpounded of a hotchpotch of al Popish errours, then the natural ſea is of the gathering togither of many waters. VVhich Council was begun ſome yeres before, (as we have shewed, chap. 11.7.) but at length was made an end of, and confirmed by the definite ſentence of P. Paul the 4. at the requeſt of the Cardinals Moronus and Simoneca, in the name of the reſt of the Council, in the yeare 1564. Into this <hi>ſea</hi> of errors, the yere after, and the eight next folowing, the <hi>ſecond Angel</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Chemnitius powred out his vial: who began and compoſed a <hi>Trial</hi> of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:6819:222"/> this Tridentine Council, and found it to be nothing but an horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Chaos of many monſtrous opinions. But this occaſion, forthwith upſtarted many doughty Papiſts to mainteyn the ſame: who behaved the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo fortunatly in this ſervice, that by defending the <hi>bloud,</hi> they turned it into rotten bloud; that is heaped up many more peſtilent errors, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were before. Among the reſt, there roſe up handlers of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies at Rhenes, Doway, Loven, as frontier Captaynes; by whoſe induſtrie it came to paſſe, that al the durt which lay ſtinking about here and there in many ditches, was ſcraped togither into one channel, that therof at length mought exiſt this <hi>rotten ſea.</hi> But above al, the heaping togither of waters moſt fowl with carrayn bloud, was playn to be ſeen, when P. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the 13. in the yere 1571. procured two ample Colleges to be built at Rome, for to corrupt youth beyond the Alpes; and made Robert Bellar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mine maſter of this worke; that he should u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fold the controverſies of faith, unto the ſtudents of thoſe Colleges. For he, that he might the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his auditors, that is, the ſooner deſtroy them; thought it not beſt to labour about any one point, two or three; as many others had doon be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore; but <hi>to bring al controverſies into one body as it were, which he ſaw was yet wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting,</hi> as himſelfe confeſſeth in his Epiſtle to the Pope. Wherby, through Gods good providence, it came to paſſe, that an intyre and perfect body of Popish doctrine, abſolute in al points, which never was before, being largely diſputed in theſe books of controverſies, did now come forth in publik: that they which willingly ſhut not their eyes, might ſee the <hi>Sea playnly turned into filthy bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And every living ſoul dyed in the Sea:</hi> But how can this be, (may ſome ſay,) ſeing every ſowl liveth not in the ſea? This, it may be, cauſed Theod. Beza to tranſplace the words thus, <hi>and whatſoever thing lived in the ſea, dyed:</hi> But the natural order of the words hath a meaning agreable with al other of this book, and of this kinde.

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:6819:223"/> But al the elect, have their dwelling in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the Temple is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in heaven, chap. 15.6. ſo that they need not to be afrayd at al of this earthly ſea, whoſe rotten bloud shall kill onely the men of the ſame kind. And here all unleſſe they leave their earth, that is, unleſſe they forſake the Popes religion; shal finde deſtruction in this ſea: for no other waters ſhal they have to drink, but theſe thus filthy; nor be informed with any other doctrine, then that is drawen out of the Council of Trent, and controver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſal books of the Ieſuites. How can they then but <hi>dye preſently,</hi> if they drink of thoſe waters, wherin al the foundations of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> are turned into deadly poyſon? Moſt miſerable therfore is your eſtate, ô yee Papiſts, which drink in filthy bloud, as moſt ſweet heavenly liquour: and ſettle your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in moſt certayn deſtruction. But it is Gods juſt judgement, that they which deſpiſe the pure waters of life, ſhould miſerably periſh in this bloud: draw out, ô higheſt God, thoſe whom thou haſt deſtinate to the prayſe of thy mercy. But beſides let us know, that it is not ſafe to ſwimm in this Sodomitish lake, as many doo, which make no conſcience to aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t unto any religion. This then is the eſtate of this filthy ſea: which wel beco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth the ulcerous flock, to be fed with the rotten bloud therof, as it were with rivers.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And the third Angel powred out his vial upon the rivers:</hi> Th'effect of the third vial, belongeth to the <hi>fountayns</hi> &amp; <hi>rivers.</hi> The event turneth the ſame into <hi>bloud.</hi> Fountayns and rivers, are as the breaſts wherewith the <hi>ſea</hi> is nourrished, and which borow their nouriſhment from it againe. And the <hi>ſea,</hi> being the <hi>Doctrine:</hi> the <hi>Fountayns</hi> are the <hi>Maſters</hi> which have charge of the doctrine; and theſe, no mean fellowes, and footſtools, ſo to ſpeak; but principal Doctours, on whoſe mouth the reſt of the troup doo depend. Theſe now, by al mens iudgment, are the <hi>Ieſuites:</hi> from whoſe diſtributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the reſt of the multitude gathereth, like babes taking the meat into their mouthes, which they chewed for them. Dominicus of old appeared unto Pope Innocent in his ſleep, <hi>to hold up with his ſhoulders the Lateran Church, that was in danger of ruine:</hi> but at this day, the Ieſuites be the chiefeſt propps of the Popes throne: which nevertheleſſe they shall not hold up long; who long ſynce have begun to faulter and fayl as overcharged with the weight. For under this <hi>third vial,</hi> the <hi>rivers</hi> shalbe turned into <hi>bloud;</hi> that is, thoſe Maſters of Popish doctrine, the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> shalbe put to death; that the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch of Rome, which in time paſt was wont to kill with the ſword, may at length be killed her ſelfe, as the Spirit hath foretold, chap 13.10. Which power this vial began to exerciſe about the year 1581. when in our realm of England, by the common decree of the States in Parliament, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:6819:223"/> that <hi>whoſoever ſhould goe about any manner of way to draw the mindes of the ſubiects from obedience towards their lawful and natural Prince, unto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, or unto the Romiſh religion for the ſame end: they ſhould be put to death as guilty of high treaſon.</hi> What is this, may ſome ſay, to the Ieſuites? Very much when they al mind nothing els, indevour nothing els; being traytors to their country, killers of Princes, ſeducers of ſubiects, the plagues and bane of al Kingdomes and common weals. Therfore the powred out vial wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not effect, but in the ſame yere <hi>Everard Ducket, Edmund Campion, Ralfe Sherwin,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexander Brian,</hi> Ieſuites and nouriſſons of the Seminaries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convincted of the breach of the law, were worthily punished. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them folowed <hi>Iohn Paynes, Thomas Ford, Iohn Sherret, Robert Iohnſon,</hi> &amp; many other of that leven. Thus by Gods grace, the wickednes of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched men was ſomewhat reſtreyned: that though it were not quite taken away, (for who can require of the Leopard to change his skin?) yet did it not ſo freely range abroad, but was forced to lurk in darknes, to diſguiſe it ſelfe, to counterfeit &amp; diſſemble al things; that ſo both the venim might be diſperſed more ſecretly, and the miſcheevous heads therof, be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And I heard the Angel of the waters:</hi> We have ſeen the firſt event: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cond is a twofold teſtimony wherby the fact is approved: of which the firſt is by the Angel of the waters; who is not one of theſe <hi>rivers</hi> &amp; <hi>fountayns,</hi> as the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, before, chap. 9.11. but one that is over the rivers and fountayns to execute this iudgement of God. In which reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reſt may be called <hi>the Angel of the earth, the Angel of the ſea, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the ſun,</hi> &amp;c. to whom power is given over theſe things. For in that he ſaith in the next verſe, <hi>&amp; thou haſt given them blood to drink,</hi> he playnely exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth him from the number of them. This Angel therfore is ſome civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giſtrate, which had power, or rather which was author and Counſellor for turning theſe waters into bloud, namely for killing and putting to death the Ieſuites. Whom if I should note by name to have been that noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bleſſed memory, S. William Cicil, late high Treſurer of England: the words folowing wil shew, I doe it not without ground.</p>

And a like celebration of Gods iuſtice, was verily made by him whom even now I named, S. William Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. For he in the yere 1584. to ſtop the mouth of gaynſaying raylers, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a reaſon in a book ſet forth, of putting the Ieſuites to death among us. VVhich book is intituled <hi>the Iuſtice of Britany;</hi> wherby is clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:6819:224"/> that ſome lewd fellowes in England were for shamefull treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s put to death. He published the book almoſt in all languages, that all might hear the Angel celebrating Gods iuſtice; and others that would procure the ſafety of their realmes and peoples, might be ſtirred up by this moſt worthy preſident, to doo the like. The book hath the very ſame argument that theſe two verſes have; neither can the ſumm of it be compriſed in any words more fitt.</p>

VVe shewed that this maner of ſpeach be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>longs unto them which ar killed for Chriſt, which have a place given them under the altar, chap. 6.9. Therfore this Angel is one of that flock, which ſufferring calamitie for Chriſts name, dooth by his ſentence approve the fact of killing the Ieſuites, and for that cauſe celebrateth in like ſorte the juſtice of God. Even as it is manifeſt to have fallen out in the yere 1586. April 4. when the States of Holland and of the other Provinces confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with them, did decree, <hi>that none of the bloudy ſect of the Ieſuits, or that then was a ſtudent with the profeſſors of it, whither he were born within the confederate Provinces, or a forreyner, ſhould creep into thoſe provinces, eyther by ſea or by La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, under payn of hoſtility and loſſe of his life.</hi> By which decree they give their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict againſt thoſe ungracious men, and ſubſcribe to the ſentence erſt give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <hi>Angel of the waters</hi> in England.

Although they now by uſe have learned, that ther is more confort in theſe calamities, then in al Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish deynties, which in time paſt they injoyed, when they wanted the holy truth the while. VVerfore, you noble Hollanders, cleave ſtil with perfect harts to him, by whoſe defenſe you have hitherto been kept ſafe. Beware of the Romish wiles; doo not ſo deal, as that now by hearkning to Popiſh Sinons, your conſtancy paſt avayl you nothing, ſave to let you have tryall of your new feigned freinds to be noyſome foes.

Take heed; be not diſmayed with fear of any peril, though al men should forſake you.

I could not chuſe but by the way to warne in a word my brethren that are in danger. I come againe to the matter. Two yeres before that decree was made by the Hollanders, when the French King Henry the 4 was wounded, by Iohn Caſtell a Ieſuite, who had decreed to kill him: this worthy ſentence was uttered in the Seſsion of the great Chamber, both againſt this Caſtell, and the whole hierd of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuites; namely, <hi>that all the Prieſts of the College of Clermont, and all others that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8 <hi>And the fourth Angel powred out his vial upon the Sun:</hi> Hitherto have bin theſe times wherin now we live; for unto this vial have our ages come: the other foure ar by us to be looked for, ſo that the ſerching of them out is the more difficult. Notwithſtanding we truſting in his guidance alone, by whoſe conduct we are come hitherto; and being holpen by the light of thoſe that ar paſſed, which we have drawn from the former explication: doo hope that we shal bring ſomwhat, which may be profitable for the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of them that are to come. The proper force of this vial, is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the <hi>Sun:</hi> wherof ther is a tow fold event; firſt, <hi>a power given to the Sun, to ſcorch men by fire;</hi> in this verſe: ſecondly, <hi>a very great heat of men, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie and obduration;</hi> in the 9. verſe. As touching the <hi>Sun,</hi> the borowed ſpeech is like the former. For the ſame men complayn of the greatnes of this heat, which felt the former calamities; as in the next verſe, <hi>and they blaſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phemed the name of God which hath power over theſe plagues.</hi> But if it be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of any Sun-burning properly; how dooth it afflict the bad, more then the good, ſeing both of them dwel togither on earth, and the one ſort ar no more covered from the force of the heavenly bodyes, then the other? But ther is no other <hi>Sun</hi> to be thought of, then the <hi>vial</hi> which is powred out upon it: which we have shewed to be caled ſo, rather for ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:6819:225"/> than for any reſpect of proper nature. Let the uſual ſignification therfore of this word remayn, wherby it denoteth <hi>the holy Scriptures:</hi> with whoſe light the dark minds of men are no leſſe illuſtrated, then the eyes of the body are with the beames of the Sun. Vpon theſe is this <hi>vial</hi> to be pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, not for to hurt them, as the former vials did the <hi>earth, ſea,</hi> &amp; <hi>rivers:</hi> but for to give them a kind of force and edge, wherby they may prick the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and peirce the deeper. How notable the goodnes of God is in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pect towards theſe laſt times: ther is no man, unleſſe he be ſhamefully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull and envious, but doth acknowledge. For by the paynes of ſome very excellent, (for why may I not ſo cal thoſe learned men, which have ſo greatly holpen Chriſtian religion with their ſtudies?) many things are made unto us moſt eaſy and playn, in which the ages paſt, have been much deceived. Neither is this a vayn boaſting of our times; but a true preaching of the bounty of God.

                  <hi>the light of the Moone ſhalbe as the light of the Sun; and the light of the Sun ſhalbe ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven fold like the light of ſeven dayes; in the day that the Lord ſhall bind up the breach of their wound,</hi> Iſa 30.26. as partly by the things that folow, wil appeare more manifeſt. Many things ther are in the Scriptures, not yet ſufficiently explayned: but the neerer we come unto that day, the more copiouſly wil the light increaſe dayly, by the neer beams of the riſing Sun. That I may tel the very thing; Antichriſt is in deed layd open, now long agoe through the grace of God, in marvelous manner: but ſeing in theſe yeeres wherin now we live, and wherunto the order of time hath brought us, the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men of the ſeat of Rome, have felt nothing heavier, then that their Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuits should be put to death, which was the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the vial next before; this burning heat of the Sun is to be expected ere long, even ſome greater perſpicuity of the Scriptures, wherby <hi>the man of ſin</hi> may be more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcorched. His filthines shalbe diſcovered yet more, wherupon men will the more hate him; which wil drive him and his unto ſuch intemperance, that he wil gnash and rage againſt the Sun which hath manifeſted to the world his ſo horrible hiew, that himſelfe shal not indure to behold the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Wherfore I am to exhort you, yee learned men, whom God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned above others with a ſingular facultie of perceiving and illuſtrating the truth: that ye would diligently employ your ſelves in this noble work for the Church. You hear what a <hi>garlond</hi> God hath reſerved for theſe laſt times. Great is the prayſe of our Anceſtors, which firſt plucked off Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts vizar: no leſſe will theirs be, which shal utterly hyſſe him and drive off the ſtage. Yea they are wont in ſpecial, to make the triumphe, which doo make an end of the battel. This onely conflict ſeemeth to be left for
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:6819:226"/> learned men: the more are they to be ſtyrred up to apply their ſtudies. That which further dooth remayn, fyre and ſoword shal performe; and shall not be accomplished by ynk and pen.</p>

Shall others alſo be burned with this <hi>Sun,</hi> beſides the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Antichriſt? verily ſo it ſeemeth. Hypocrites and all others that ar not indued with true godlines, whatſoever religion they profeſſe, cannot endure that their wickednes should be manifeſted, and reproved by the light of the heavenly truth. Wherupon it is no marvel if many other earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly men alſo, which are not of the Popes profeſsion, be moleſted by this heat of the Sun. But the words of the next verſe, <hi>which hath power over theſe plagues,</hi> ſeem to be of thoſe men, as I ſayd, which have felt the former ſcour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges alſo.

                  <hi>burn,</hi> doth ſufficiedtly expreſſe the burning of the Sun? It is that wee may know, that the heat wherwith they shall boyle, ſhall not be heavenly but earthly; ſuch as is <hi>fire,</hi> to weet, envy, contention, ſtrife, and al bitternes of minde. For <hi>fire</hi> is here metaphorical, which playnly sheweth that this is not the proper <hi>Sun,</hi> ſeing it worketh not by it own but by an others ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Such then shalbe the firſt event, that men shall boyl in heat, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a ſecret exacerbation of their mindes, but even by open brawles and reproches. But shal the <hi>Angel of the Sun,</hi> receave ſuch a reward? It had bin better for him to have ſtopt his vial, that it might not diſtill ſuch trouble unto him. But let him not be diſcouraged: God will prepare him a ſecret place with himſelfe; to keepe him from the virulence of tongues. The ſame hath been the condition of al the Prophets alway: ſo it is with the holy book, that being <hi>taſted, it is ſweet in the mouth as honey; but being eaten, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the belly bitter:</hi> chap. 10.9. Wherfore let ungratious men reproch free<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly; ſo as the manifeſtation of their wickednes doo move their choler.</p>

Now therfore ſee what this greater light and heat ſhal effect: it shal drive men to blaſphemy; but they ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſt in their wickednes, no leſſe then before.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: that which now next is to be looked for, is calamity that shal come u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this very city.

The farr-dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Sun</hi> did ſcortch, but it was from farr: now, the tops of his ſacred Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace shall fal down; wherby the brightnes of the Popes Kingdome shalbe turned into darknes. For how should it not be covered with mournfull blacknes, when the Princely Court is cut down, and Chaire overthrown, which they were wont to vaunt should be eternal, and that <hi>Hel gates ſhould not prevayl againſt it?</hi> To prove which point, Bellarmine bringeth many rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons: but the ſpeedy event wil teach, how he was deceived. Although ſome Ieſuites, being forced hereunto by the truth, doo now beginn to ſpeak of the deſtruction of it. VVich yet they wil have to be, not becauſe of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; but before his birth, or at leaſt before he shal begin his reign. But this fiction, we wil take away in his place.

It ſeemeth unto me, that they are here meant, for whoſe ſake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the ſcripture mentioneth the waters of old to have bin dryed up; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely the <hi>Iewes,</hi> unto whom the read ſea yeilded paſſage, and Iarden ſtayed his courſe, til every one were gone over, journying on foot through the deep. This miracle is proper to this people onely: for that which Ioſephus writeth that the <hi>ſea of Pamphilia gave way to the Macedonians,</hi> when Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der led his hoſt that way: (Antiquit. b. 2. chap. 7.) Other writers doo playnly shew, how the thing is to be underſtood. Plutarch, (in Alexand.) ſayth that <hi>Hiſtorie-writers amplifyed the thing beyond al credit: and that Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelfe never boaſted of any ſuch wonder in his Epiſtles.</hi> Arianus writeth that uſually ther is no way to paſſe through the ſea neer Phaſelis, but when the North winds blow; which blew vehemently when Alexander went that way, that they ſeemed, not without Gods power, to have yeilded them an eaſy paſſage. But Strabo book 14, writeth moſt playnly, <hi>that the ſoldiers tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veiled
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:6819:228"/> al the day even up to the navel in the waters.</hi> So then Alexander paſſed through the waters that were shollow, and not quite dryed up. Neyther doo I think can it be found in any record; that ſuch a thing did ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to any other people then the Iewes. The vanity of writers may feign many things: but the Scriptures doo challenge this, as peculiar to this na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion onely. <hi>I will ſay,</hi> ſayth God, <hi>to the deep, be dry, and I wil dry up thy flouds,</hi> Iſa 44.27. And againe, <hi>Art not thou the ſame, which dryed up the ſea, even the waters of the great deep: making the deeps of the Sea, to be a way for the redeemed to paſſe over?</hi> Iſa 51.10. And leaſt ſome should thinke this miracle was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the time paſst, and not ſuch to be looked for ever after: he addeth in the next verſe; <hi>So the redeemed of the Lord ſhal returne, and come with joy into Sion &amp;c.</hi> And in Iſa 63.11. <hi>where</hi> should he be <hi>that brought theſe up out of the ſea with the ſhepheard of his flock? which cleft the waters for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe, to make himſelfe an everlaſting name? which led theſe through the deepe, as an horſe in the wildernes, ſo that they ſtumbled not?</hi> It is no marvel therfore, if the peculiar note &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of this nation onely, be putt for the men themſelves. But what need there a way to be prepared for them? Shal they returne agayn to Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Ther is nothing more ſure: the Prophets playnly confirme it, and beat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon it. Yet not to the end that the ceremonial worship should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: but that the mercy of God may shine unto al the world, in giving to a nation now ſcatered over al the face of the earth, &amp; dwelling no where but by leave; their fathers habitations, wherin they shal ſerve Chriſt pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſincerely, according to his owne ordinance onely. A thing of old commonly ſpoken of by the ancient Iewes, which they underſtood by the Prophets, although but narrowly and through the lattiſſe. Wherupon it was berayed with old wives fables, both in ages paſt, and ſo is now at this day. The feighned Eſdras ſaw ſome ſparkles of this truth; which he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſo many and great fictions, that he had need be a wary and attentive reader, and one of no mean judgement, that would gather gold out of that confuſed heap. <hi>They entred in,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaking of the ten tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes that were led captives, <hi>at the narrow paſſages of the river Euphrates: for the moſt high then ſhewed them ſignes, and ſtayed the ſprings of the river, til they were paſſed over,</hi> 4. Eſdras, 13.43.44. A Iewiſh fable: but neerer to the truth is that which there foloweth, ver. 47. <hi>The moſt high ſhal hold ſtil the ſprings of the river agayn, that they may goe through: &amp;c.</hi> which agreeth with this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, &amp; may both of them be underſtood metaphorically: though nothing letteth, why it may not pleaſe God agayn to shew his ancient power of drying waters up extraordinarily. Seing therfore it is certayn, that this na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion shal earneſtly flock unto the Goſpel, and that in the laſt times, as
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:6819:228"/> Paul teacheth, Rom. 11.25. and the laſt period of things is of the vials: &amp; it is not likely that ſuch a wonderful matter should have no mention at al in this clear Propheſie: unto which alſo here is added the proper enſigne of this nation, for whoſe onely ſake, both <hi>ſea</hi> &amp; <hi>river</hi> (as we read) were <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up:</hi> I am not altogither unadviſed, in ſuppoſing, that this is the onely matter here in hand: which muſt eyther be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in this place, or be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted in this book. VVherfore after Rome is overthrown and cut off there shalbe a common bruit of this new Chriſtian people: at the hearing wherof the Gentiles shalbe aſtonished. But what, are the Iewes <hi>Kings?</hi> why not? ſeing al Chriſtians are <hi>Kings,</hi> Rev. 1.6. and the fowr and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Elders, which repreſente the whole company of the faithful, doe all wear <hi>crownes:</hi> chap. 4.4. And this magnificent name doth the Spirit give them, becauſe it shalbe very honourable, after ſo many ages, and ſo ſtiff ſtubbornes of that nation; for them to come againe, as it were by recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of law, unto the truth; and religiouſly and holily with al obſervance to honour the ſame, having their incredulous and obſtinate harts ſubdued. But beſides this the whole Eaſt shal obey them, that not without cauſe ar this people caled <hi>Kings,</hi> in reſpect of their long and large dominion &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pire. But they ſeem to be called playnly <hi>Kings</hi> in Iſay 24.21. if we diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly mark the words and meaning of the place: <hi>And it ſhalbe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in that day the Lord wil viſit the hoſt of the high, in the high place; and the Kings of the earth, upon the earth. And they ſhalbe gathered with a gathering as a priſoner into a pit, and ſhalbe cloſed up in the cloſe-place: and after many dayes ſhal they be viſited. And the Moon ſhalbe abaſhed, and the Sun aſhamed, when the Lord of hoſts ſhall reign in mount Sion, and in Ieruſalem: and</hi> ſhalbe <hi>glorious, before his Ancients,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Kings of the earth,</hi> are al one; who after are <hi>gathered into the pit, after many dayes are viſited;</hi> and at whoſe deliverance, <hi>the Moon is abaſhed &amp;c.</hi> VVhich laſt words are certenly meant of the ful reſtoring of the Iewes: wherfore the firſt words intend alſo the ſame. VVhom God, in heavy indignation, becauſe they refuſed his Son, did thruſt into the pit or dungeon, for many ages togither, and kept them cloſed up in a very hard priſon. But at length after many dayes he will viſit theſe priſoners, and bring them out of the gayl: for whoſe ferve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t zele and ſingular ſtudy of true godlines, the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of the Gentiles as the <hi>Moon</hi> &amp; <hi>Sun,</hi> shalbe abashed at this greater brightnes. They ar caled <hi>the hoſt of the high, in the high;</hi> becauſe the Iewes were the peculiar people of the high God, and of his Church which is heavenly: wherupon they ar often caled in Daniel, <hi>qaddiſche hheljonin,</hi> the <hi>Saincts of the high;</hi> Dan. 7.22. &amp;c. But this is inough to find out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this place: I may not now ſtand longer upon it. I have handled it
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:6819:229"/> the more at large, for to give occaſion unto our men to mind theſe things more diligently. Theſe Kings come from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> becauſe the greateſt multitude of Iewes, is in thoſe countries: and theſe firſt of all shal ſee the truth, and embrace the ſtudy of it. But, thou wilt ſay, <hi>The Temple is ſhut, until the ſeven plagues be fufilled:</hi> which we shewed to be ſpoken in reſpect of the Iewes, chap. 15.8. But that is to be underſtood of their univerſal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: and here onely the beginning of it is taught, as we shal declare after more at large. And by theſe things we may ſee, how the <hi>ſixt vial,</hi> anſwereth to the <hi>ſixt Trompet.</hi> The trompet, ſent from Euphrates, four furies into the world: the vial shal miniſter great joy from the ſame place: which ſhal yeild new huige troupes of Chriſtians, by whoſe vertue thoſe furies shalbe ſent back to hell. But as Romes Idolatry, caled for thoſe cruel Turks: ſo after that Rome is utterly abolished, ſtraightway this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort shal appear.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>And I ſaw out of the mouth of the Dragon:</hi> The ſecond event is firſt a preparation unto warr; wherof there are three Princes Authors, &amp; as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Adminiſters, <hi>three unclean Spirits like froggs;</hi> in this verſe; whoſe work is deſcribed in the verſe folowing. The Princes are, the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> &amp; the <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> The <hi>Dragon</hi> always throughout this whole book, is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen enemy: which were the Roman Emperours, ſo long as they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hethens: in theſe laſt times, the <hi>Turks</hi> doo cary this perſon. The <hi>Beaſt</hi> is the more covert and crafty enemie, <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſitting in the Temple of God; as in the 13 chap. The <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> is now firſt named, and often henceforth after the fift vial. But ther muſt needs have been ſome deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of him ſome where before: for Iohn ſpeaketh as of a perſon wel known. And this verily we shal find in that ſubtil and crafty <hi>ſecond Beaſt;</hi> of whom we heard in chap. 13.11. &amp;c. who wrought <hi>ſignes and wondrous lyes.</hi> Both of them perteyned to the conſtituting of the ſame Antichriſt; but with this condition, that the <hi>firſt</hi> ſignifyed the temporal and civil ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: the <hi>ſecond,</hi> the ſpiritual fraud and malice, as is ſayd before. This <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Beaſt is now plainly caled the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> by reaſon of the more ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſt revelation, which ſhalbe under this <hi>ſixt vial.</hi> For though he reteyne yet with him many attendants, yet the better part of men, and they of his former worshippers; shal know him for a crafty lying hypocrite, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt him as a lothſome creature. For now the event wil teach, after Rome is deſtroyed, how glorious lyes thoſe were, about <hi>Peters Chaire;</hi> the <hi>Holines of the Church of Rome,</hi> the <hi>invincible ſtedfadnes and perpetual conſtancy of it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the practiſes of al.</hi> Wherfore the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> is one Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; but having a double power, al which he wil now uſe, both civil &amp; ſpiritual; to deceive the unskilful, and draw them agayn to be of his ſide.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:6819:229"/> He wil open his treaſury, he wil ſpare no charges, he wil levie huge bands of ſouldjers, and other things that perteyn to force. Neither wil he be leſſe diligent to catch the ſimple, by al ſpiritual fraud, counterfeiſance, fallacies, and other like legierdumain of lyes and errours; wherby he may abuſe their payn and help unto this laſt battel which he now prepareth. So the <hi>Turk,</hi> the <hi>Caeſarean Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Pope-Balaam;</hi> are theſe <hi>three mouthes,</hi> which at laſt wil belk out the <hi>Froggs</hi> in their time.</p>

Out of the mouth of the Pope falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he hath the Ieſuites in ſpecial, and the other toades of his wicked Hierarchie.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement they take this work in hand; as is manifeſt by the vow of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, wherby the Ieſuites are bound to the Pope. But why are they called Spirits? Is it becauſe they ar like the breath which comes out of the mouth and have very neer alliance to them of whom they are breathed, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing and animating them, and agayn borowing of them <hi>heat</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtink?</hi> Verily theſe three Emiſſaries, ar joynd in neer alliance with theſe their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: they draw from them heat and life; and life they give unto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Or is it perhaps becauſe they shew themſelves no leſſe diligent &amp; mighty in executing their buſines, then the Spirits bee? Surely the world hath now experience of the ſingular vigilancy and almoſt incredible indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtrie of theſe <hi>three Emiſſaries;</hi> and it is not likely that they wilbe more ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish in the laſt combate. They are like to <hi>Froggs;</hi> becauſe they reioyce in their moſt filthy and unclean pollutions, from which they draw begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and life. They refuſe to be clothed with Chriſts righteouſnes, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting themſelves to be clean ynough before God in their own myre. And when before, the <hi>Sea</hi> was made like dead mans <hi>blood:</hi> what other thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take pleaſure in ſuch a fowle Camarine-puddle, than Froggs, Toads, and other like fennish and execrable filth? But beſides their uncleannes, they have alſo an importunate croaking: for no means doo theſe ſtirrers up of troubles, and fighting furies, leave unaptented; for to ſet al the world to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither by the ears. But why is ther no difference between the Miniſters of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of the <hi>Turk?</hi> Becauſe albeit nothing is more common with them than the name of Chriſt; (wherupon they wilbe caled <hi>Ieſuits;</hi>) never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, whiles they hope for life and ſalvation by their owne merits; they differ nothing from heathens, which deſpiſe Chriſt altogither.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>For they are Spirits of Devils:</hi> He deſcribeth yet more largely the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Rev. 13.13. They <hi>goe forth to gather the Kings of the earth unto battel:</hi> for after that Euphrates shalbe dryep up, and the way prepared for the Eaſtern Iewes: the Turk fearing himſelfe, wil pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare warr againſt them, with as great furniture as he can; as is more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in Daniel, chap. 11.44. Nor wil the Romiſh Beaſt togither with the falſe Prophet in the Weſt, be leſſe ſtudious to abolish utterly all them that favour pure religion. He wil prudently take his oportunity, when the Turk shalbe imployed in the Eaſtern warr. Wherby it shal come to paſſe, that in one &amp; the ſame time, the ſafety of the whole Church ſhall be in very great danger. This is that warr, whoſe alarme theſe <hi>Froggs</hi> doo ſound unto the Kings of the earth.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Behold I come as a theef:</hi> Theſe words doo trouble the learned man Th. Beza, as if they had crept in hither amiſſe from ſome other place. But feing theſe times shalbe very calamitous, as in reſpect of the Iewes Daniel foretold, chap. 12.1. neyther is it likely that our Chriſtian nations ſhalbe in better caſe: let not this warning ſeem ſuperfluous or importune unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The greatnes of the peril, may deterr even the ſtrongeſt man. But leaſt any ſhould hitt againſt this rock and make ſhipwrak; Chriſt biddeth him be of good courage, and not through any fear, to forſake the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith, (which here he calleth <hi>garments,</hi> and which the adverſaries will moſt ſeek to bereav us of:) promiſing that he wil come <hi>as a theef</hi> unwares, and doo vengeance on the enemies above al expectation, and defend his Church.</p>
               <p>A like comfort ther was, chap. 13.10. &amp; 14.13. that we may know, ſuch hortatorie voices muſt needs be new, and are not fruitleſſe, but ſeaſonable &amp; very neceſſary. Neither are theſe words brought in abruptly; but wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the words next before, mention was made of <hi>God almighty,</hi> theſe ar for more force related in his perſon.</p>

But by whoſe means ſoever they be gathered; governed they are by the ſecret providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Chriſt. For being led by the hand of God, they come togither of their own accord into that place, from whence there shalbe no way to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. Which place is caled in Hebrew <hi>Armagedon,</hi> as Montanus and Plan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tins edition readeth it with a ſingle <hi>d;</hi> as alſo doth Aretas, ſave with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a letter, <hi>Ermagedon</hi> And perhaps theſe had doon right, if they had kept the aſpiration <hi>Harmagedon,</hi> for ſo I ſuppoſe this word shoul be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as, (if I be not deceived,) wil appear by that which foloweth. Th.

But this place was pernicious to the Church, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous to the wicked: but <hi>Armagedon</hi> here ſeems the contrary. Iohn Fox our countryman of bleſſed memorie, bringeth a fitter application, as me thinketh, for he ſaith this place hath not reſpect unto <hi>Joſias,</hi> but unto that notable victory which Debora and Barak with a ſmal company, got over the huge hoſt of <hi>Siſera,</hi> at the town of <hi>Megiddo</hi> ſituate on a mountayn, Iud. 5.10. &amp;c. Notwithſtanding whiles I conſider the thing attentively with my ſelf, ther ſeemeth no ſuch matter here to be meant; but that an alluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather is made unto that of Daniel, chap. 11.45. <hi>And he ſhal fix the tents of Aphadnon between the ſeas (Lehar tſebi qodeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h) in the mountayn of holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autie.</hi> By many arguments it may be shewed, that this propheſie of Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and that of Iohn, doo perteyn to the ſame times namely to this ſixt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as at ſome other time, if God permit, we wil manifeſt. The difference onely is, that there particularly it is ſpoken of the Turk, the enemy of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iewes: here jointly it is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the enemies of the whole Church, as wel of Gentiles as of Iewes. And the place is deſigned by name, where the Iewes enemy shal camp, namely <hi>lehar, tſebi qodheſch, in the mount of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty of holines,</hi> that is, in the holy land, between the Siriak ſea and Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:6819:231"/> which is alſo caled, a ſea, in the Scriptures. But in this Propheſie, wher the Spirit univerſally doth deſcribe the place of that warr, he could not uſe that name which is proper to the Iewes. Therfore he made a new word which should be common to ech people, and come very neer unto that in ſignification. For <hi>Harmagedon</hi> is made of <hi>Har</hi> a <hi>Mountayn,</hi> &amp; <hi>meg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadhim of delites;</hi> or with an affix in the ſingular number <hi>maghdo, of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite.</hi> The very ſame that <hi>Har tſebhi</hi> is, <hi>the mount of the Roe.</hi> For <hi>tſebhi a Roe,</hi> ſignifieth alſo <hi>pleaſantnes</hi> or <hi>delite.</hi> A word of paramours, when they would ſpeake to their loves moſt amiably; as in Salomons ſong, <hi>my beloved is like a Roe</hi> &amp;c chap. 2.9. By theſe things then it doth appeare, that the place is foretold by name in Daniel, where the Turk shal fight with the Iewes: but here, where the Beaſt ſhall combat with the Church of the Gentiles, the ſame is onely intimated generally. As if <hi>Armagedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And there come a great voice out of the Temple of heaven:</hi> The firſt event, is <hi>a great voice,</hi> which is deſcribed by the <hi>place</hi> whence it cometh, and the <hi>thing</hi> that it ſpeaketh. The <hi>place,</hi> is not onely the <hi>Temple of Heaven,</hi> but alſo the <hi>throne</hi> it ſelfe; the deſcription wherof, was in chap. 4.2. The Temple is the dwelling place of the Saincts, as we have ſeen before: this Throne is the ſeat of the higheſt Maieſtie: which being placed in midds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:6819:231"/> of the faithfull, shineth with the incomprehenſible brightes of the moſt holy Trinity. Wherfore this voice commeth immediatly from God in reſpect of the Miniſtery of the Church. Wherby is ſignifyed, that God under this vial, wil in extraordinary manner and almoſt beyond exſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, provide for his; shewing forth his power from heaven, for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction of al the enemies, which were gathered, (as even now we heard) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place <hi>Armagedon:</hi> which interpretation we shal ſee more fully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by that which foloweth, where a larger explication of this vial is ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dled. The voice uttered is, <hi>It is doon:</hi>

                  </gap>: moſt fitt for the finishing of things, as we know it was uſed in the creating of them, Gen. 1. &amp; it hath this meaning, as if he should ſay; Al things now have bin, which I decreed to be doon; neyther remayneth any more of my promiſes, the compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherof should be exſpected on earth. For this ſame, <hi>Is doon,</hi> hath refere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce unto that in chap. 10.7. <hi>In the dayes of the voice of the ſeventh Angel, when he ſhal ſound the trompet, the Myſterie of God ſhalbe finiſhed.</hi> Now shal ther be an end of al propheſies, when both al the enemies are utterly extinguished, &amp; there is one sheepfold made throughout the earth, of al the elect, Iewes and Gentiles, under the one Paſtor Ieſus Chriſt. It is certain that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, thus begunn, shal be eternal; never to be interrupted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn: and shall at laſt be tranſlated from earth into heaven. But of the time, wherin this tranſlation shall fall out, which is to be performed at his ſecond coming: I find no mention in this book. This propheſie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds no further, then to the laſt deſtruction of al the enemies, and ful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Iewish nation: the eſtate of which people ſo reſtored, and of the whole Church of al nations, he telleth shalbe moſt happy, but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down no moment of time, when they shal leav the earth, and goe to their heavenly heritage. Theſe things shalbe made manifeſt by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation folowing: ſome taſt wherof was here to be given, leaſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too much attending unto the whole order of things, should ſlip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that errour of ſetting down the certain time of the laſt day: which thing I ſee ſome godly and learned men to buſy themſelves about; as if by this vial ſome very neer moment therof mought be aſsigned. Which thing, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon more diligent examination, we find to be wholly layd up in exſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hope, and not at al put in any comhrehenſion of ſenſe. Now the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the <hi>ſeventh vial</hi> with the <hi>ſeventh trompet</hi> is, that in this, Chriſts Kingdome is begunn, the enemies being in part abolished, as chap. 11.15, wherupon a voice there ſayd, <hi>the Kingdome of the world is become Chriſts:</hi> but in the other, Chriſts Kingdome is conſumate, al enemies being quite taken away; wherfore the voice of this is, <hi>It is doon.</hi>

Thirdly, <hi>what effects,</hi> in reſpect of the reprobates; verſe 21. <hi>Lightnings, thonders, voices,</hi> shall come from heaven: the <hi>earth,</hi> shalbe moved &amp; shaken: wherby is taught, that both <hi>heaven</hi> &amp; <hi>earth</hi> shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpire, for vengeance on the impious: both which shal powr out whatſoever direful-puniſhment it hath, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked crew. And this not after the uſual manner of former times; but with ſuch horrible terrour, as never was ſince the world was made. For nowe ther shalbe a viſible ſemblance of the infernal punishment, which it ſhall feel at length, in the laſt judgement. Moreover theſe kinds of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts doo declare, that the enemies shalbe deſtroyed rather by the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power of God, than by any work and endevour of men; which after ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth more clearly, in chap. 19.20. and 20.9.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>And the great City was</hi> rent <hi>into three parts:</hi> The ſecond branch of the ſecond event, <hi>upon what</hi> this iudgement shalbe exerciſed; which partly are <hi>places,</hi> partly <hi>men.</hi> The places be <hi>cities</hi> &amp; <hi>nations.</hi> The cities are three, in this verſe; <hi>the great city; the cities of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Babylon.</hi> But what is this <hi>great City?</hi> We have heard before, that a city ſignifieth not onely ſome towne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſed with walls, which many cityzens dwell in, conioyned togither by the bonds of the ſame lawes and right: but alſo the whole dition &amp; empire of any city; as the <hi>tenth part</hi> of Rome fell, when Germany withdrew it ſelf from the yoke of the ſervitude therof; chap. 11.13. Is it then the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> onely? In deed ſo this was caled before, <hi>the great city,</hi> chap. 11.8. but foraſmuch as in this place, the ful deſtruction of al the wicked is handled, (for the vial is powred into the aier, as we ſayd;) it compriſeth whatſoever Dominion and Empire the foes and enemies of the Church, have in any place. It comprehendeth therfore the Turkiſh tyranny alſo, which togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Romish, conſtituteth this great city, as is more evident by the deſtruction of this city. For it is rent into 3. <hi>parts,</hi> proportionable to the <hi>three Princes,</hi> by whom it is ruled; namely the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Falſe Prophet,</hi> before in ver. 13. Wherfore by this three fold declaration, ther falleth togither, al the Turkish and Mahumetish tyranny, that is, the <hi>Dragons:</hi> al the power of the Beaſt, that is, of the <hi>Caeſarean Biſhop:</hi> all the authority of the Falſe Prophet, that is, of <hi>Pope Balaam:</hi> for this man of ſyn, after the ruine of his throne, remayneth even unto this laſt overthrow. The <hi>firſt vial,</hi> was but a preparative for the warr: this <hi>ſeventh,</hi> is of the laſt deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the cities of the Gentils fell:</hi> VVe heard of the univerſal Empire of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:6819:232"/> the impious. But not this onely shall fal in common: but alſo in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar al the confederate cities and provinces, both Turkish, Mahumetiſh, &amp; Popiſh. For <hi>Gentils</hi> be al they that are aliants from the truth: whither they be farther of from the ſame, as the Barbarous nations, or neerer as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who by a falſe title are counted Chriſtians. For we have ſeen before, how to the <hi>Gentiles was given the Court which was ioyned to the Temple,</hi> as alſo to them was given <hi>the holy city:</hi> which were the places of that rowt which boaſted to be Chriſtians, by a vayne tytle, without ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And that great Babylon:</hi> The third place which shal utterly perish, is <hi>that great Babylon.</hi> But did not that perish before, under the fift vial, when <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Beaſts throne</hi> did fall, verſe 10? For ſo we ſaw it caled before, <hi>Fallen Fallen is Babylon the great city;</hi> chap. 14.8. In deed <hi>Rome</hi> did perish before: but it was new Rome, new Babylon, to weet, <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For every mighty, proud, Idolatrous, bloudy, impious city, may be caled <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:</hi> but ſpecially next after Rome, Conſtantinople; the onely daughter and heyr unto a farthing of her mother Rome: whoſe natural diſpoſition as she drew by ſtock; ſo did she deſervedly take the name, being caled <hi>new Rome.</hi> And ſurely it ſeemeth the ſame order of things shalbe here: firſt that al the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Popiſh</hi> forces shalbe beaten down and deſtroyed: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that al the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federate <hi>cities</hi> &amp; <hi>provinces,</hi> if they alſo doo not quite perish, shal yet at leaſt be under new Governours: thirdly, that the chief city of the Turks, this Babylon, shal bear the iuſt punishment of her impiety. And it may be, the VVeſt Chriſtians, after that the Popes name is extinguished, and that the Turk is overthrown in the Eaſt; wil shew forth their wrath on Conſtantinople, and execute the iudgement mentioned in this place. By which now we may underſtand, that al our enterpriſes againſt the Turk, shalbe vain; until <hi>Rome</hi> be overthrown. For she at the firſt caled for the Turk, as we have learned from chap. 9.20.21. nor shal his ſcourge be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moved, til the cauſe be quite taken away. But after that the Beaſts <hi>throne</hi> is conſumed with fyre, &amp; the laſt Popish warr is doon: then shal this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tyran, without any trouble of ours, be thruſt down into hell: neyther shal we ever need to fear any more moleſtation from any reliques of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Came in remembrance before God:</hi> Now both the cauſe is mentioned of the deſtruction of the Conſtantinopolitan Babylon; and the <hi>puniſhement</hi> which shalbe inflicted on it. The cauſe is, <hi>Gods remembrance:</hi> who is ſayd to remember, both for mercy and for iudgment, when he performeth in deed, what he decreed to be doon. So long as he deferreth vengeance and wrath; he ſeemeth to forget, and to have no care or reſpect of our affaires and actions,</p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:6819:233"/>
               <p>And this dooth very wel expreſſe the horrible cruelty of this Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher with God ſuffreth them that are called Chriſtians, to be preſſed: &amp; dooth not in the mean time punish the adverſaries, nor yeild any defenſe from injury. Who wil not acknowledge that God turneth away his eyes from beholding our miſeries: when without punishment he ſuffreth us to be beaten, robbed, vexed with al reproches and contumelies, virgins &amp; wives to be defiled, whole flocks of men to be caried bound and chayned into bondage; infants to be plucked from the breſts for to be inſtructed in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetish blaſphemy, and the parents to know that they bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto eternal deſtruction? VVho, I ſay, minding theſe and many moe things, al which, Idolatry hath brought upon us: may not worthily ſay, that God hath quite forgotten our miſery? He winketh therfore at Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons wickednes, that he may drive her to encreaſe calamities on the men, which wilbe taught by no warnings. And at length when our mens impie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty shal ceaſe, the shop therof being burned and conſumed: he will caſt his eyes upon Babylon, and cal to mind al her wickednes, for to meſure meet punishment unto her. But thou mayeſt obſerve, that the Spirit dooth not exaggerate the iniquity of this city, with ſo many words as her mother Romes: becauſe the ſinns of Hethen men, although they be very heavy, ar lighter then theirs that abuſe the grace of God. As touching the words, <gap reason="foreign">

And judgements are a <hi>cup of wine,</hi> becauſe they shalbe as pleaſant to God, as wickednes was to the men: that is, he will take delight in deſtroying them; as chap. 14.10. Vnleſſe it be therfore of <hi>wine,</hi> becauſe the ſeverity shal take al ſenſe from Babylon, as over much quaffing in of wine, is wont to doe: wherupon, shee shal no more eſcape the evil, then a man that hath loſt his ſenſes through drunkenes. In which reſpect it is ſayd in Zachary, <hi>I will make Ieruſalem as a cup that cauſeth ſlomber, and I wil ſmite every horſe with ſtoniſhment, and his rider with madnes,</hi> Zach. 12.2.4. And this heaping togither <hi>of the feircenes of his wrath,</hi> ſignifyeth grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and moſt sharpe punishements: although it be not ſhewed expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely, whither it shalbe ſo pluckt up by the roots, as old Rome was befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. It is very like, that after the great calamity which it shall ſuffer, the

               <p>THVS farre hath bin the diſtinct Prophecy <hi>of the laſt Period,</hi> divided in to <hi>his ſeven articles</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Seales and trumpets:</hi> ther fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a continual narration, and more large explication of the <hi>three laſt vials,</hi> as which are of greateſt waight and ſpecial moment. The <hi>fift</hi> of which is handled in this chapter, and alſo in the whole chapter following, and in the firſt five verſes of the nineteenth: the <hi>ſixt</hi> is comprehended in the next fifteene verſes of the ſame nineteenth chapter, unto the twentith verſe. The <hi>ſeventh</hi> is continued through chap. 20. and 21. and unto the ſixt ver. of the two and twentieth. And from thence followeth <hi>the concluſion</hi> of the whole book. It maketh much for perſpicuity, to know what things agree to the time, and nature of the matter. As touching <hi>the fift,</hi> it is wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed againſt the <hi>throne of the Beaſt</hi> (as in the chapter afore ver. 10.11.) partly in declaring what and of what ſort this throne is in this whole chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter: partly in relating what things doe goe togither with the ruine of it in the chapter following, and in the beginning of the nineteenth. The <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the throne hath firſt a <hi>preparation</hi> inviting to know <hi>the damnation of the whore,</hi> ver. 1.2. And the better to know it carying him away into the wilderneſſe, ver. 3. Secondly <hi>a deſcription</hi> by a double type, one of <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> ver. 3. the other <hi>of a woman ſetting on the Beaſt,</hi> ſumptuous, and moſt filthy, ver. 4. <hi>the mother of all whoredomes,</hi> ver. 5, a <hi>Murtherer of the Martyrs,</hi> ver. 6. The interpretation wherof is ſet forth by the <hi>occaſion</hi> of it, which Iohns wondering miniſtred, ver. 6.7. afterward it is propounded in <hi>very deed,</hi> shewing what the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is, in reſpect of his <hi>whole</hi> ver. 8: attention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred up, the diſcloſing might not paſſe without fruit, ver. 9. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of the <hi>parts and heads,</hi> ver. 9.10.11. and <hi>hornes,</hi> whoſe riſing up is shewed in verſe 12. the <hi>humble ſervice</hi> which they ſhall giv to the Beaſt, ver. 13. and at length their overthrow by the Lambe, ver. 14. Such is the Beaſt.

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Then came one of the ſeven Angels:</hi> We ſayd in the Analyſis that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:6819:235"/>
               <p>The reaſon wherof ſeemeth to be this, becauſe thoſe former partly were before paſt, partly preſent, at what time the <hi>vial</hi> was powred out <hi>upon the throne:</hi> and therfore had no neede of a larger expoſition then eyther the late memory or preſent uſe and condition of things ſhould give: but the other to come did need a more ample declaration, and for the ſame cauſe all the labour remayning is converted to that point. Therfore as touching the <hi>Angel, one of the ſeven,</hi> this is the <hi>fift,</hi> who ſhall bring calamity to the <hi>throne,</hi> chap. 18.10. Of which calamity nevertheleſſe there be certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſo as by the labour of ſome, <hi>certaine eaſie ſprinklings</hi> are made, before that the whole <hi>vial</hi> is powred forth.

Theſe things ſet downe in this wiſe, let us conſider the matter it ſelfe. Firſt the <hi>Angel</hi> prepareth himſelfe a way to that which he intendeth, both <hi>by inviting Iohn</hi> to learne, and alſo by <hi>carying him</hi> to that place, where he might moſt conveniently beholde the whole matter.

Certenly shee is that <hi>Jezabell,</hi> of whom wee heard in the Church of Thyatira, that noble harlot lying ſicke now a long time in her bed, now at the laſt to be punished with death, and to be thrown out of the window, leaſt shee die of a diſeaſe, rather then by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement, chap. 2.20.

A breif deſcription of whom the Angel delivereth here to be taſted before, and the manner of the place where shee ſitteth, and of her fornicatours with whom shee had to doo. <hi>Her ſeate is upon many waters,</hi> that is, upon people, multitudes, nations, and tongues, as after in ver. 15. VVherfore shee is no common harlot that wilbe hired for a farthing, but a Princely whore, worthily called <hi>Iezabell</hi> &amp; <hi>that great one,</hi> being of ſo large and ſpatious a juriſdiction. The fornicatours are the <hi>Kings of the earth,</hi> who conſented to the ſame Idolatry with her. A moſt uſual metaphore in the Scriptures, becauſe ſpiritual adultery is of equal, yea of greater, both fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and wickednes in departing from the true God.

VVherby is taught, that the manifeſtation of this <hi>throne</hi> is to be fetched and received of the faithfull, from ſome men ſet in an obſcure place, as it were in a deſert and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, from whence no ſuch thing was expected. For as once the firſt light

We know that the <hi>Whore</hi> ſome fewe yeeres ſince hath layed ſhame aſide, but there shall come out of the deſert a newe diſhonour, wherby shee shall be conſtrayned to hide her face, unleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure shee hath learned to blush. Therfore my brethren ſet upon the whore with a new aſſault: neither let any be diſcouraged becauſe his name is of no eſtimation: God will have ſome light to come out of darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Neither let any hereafter marvaile, why Antichriſt or <hi>the Whore</hi> cannot be ſeen at <hi>Rome.</hi> There was need of a wilderneſſe for this thing.

Although according to the proportion of the clearer knowledge of this, neceſſarily alſo will follow a more ample knowledge of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> when his denne hath bene examined and viewed narrowly. For the <hi>woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> sheweth to us the place; more over the <hi>time</hi> will declare whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that place is to be counted the <hi>Throne.</hi> Which two things are neceſſarily required to this matter. And the Spirit proſecute both moſt playnly (as by his helpe wee will open the things,) as it were of ſet purpoſe, meeting with the fraude of the Ieſuits; whom by his moſt wiſe providence he fore ſaw, that being convinced touching the <hi>place,</hi> they would wrangle about the <hi>time.</hi> But by this ſo exact deſcription, he taketh away all halting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. Therfore as touching the <hi>Whore,</hi> her ſo expreſſe nothing out by <hi>Babylon, ſeven hills, ſeven Kings, flouriſhing power,</hi> and at length <hi>deſtruction,</hi> the reſt of the world being ſafe; finally by the name of the <hi>city,</hi> uſed in ſtead of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, doo moſt ſtrongly prove that the <hi>univerſall City of the Divill</hi> is not meant, but <hi>ſome ſpecial city,</hi> and namely <hi>Rome:</hi> and ſo much the more becauſe this <hi>whore</hi> is the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> And we know that the <hi>Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the Divill</hi> was attributed to a certain City, to weet, <hi>Pergamus,</hi> before in the ſecond chapter and thirteenth verſe. Therfore worthily Bellarmine, that opinion being rejected, ſayth, <hi>It is better in his iudgement, that Rome be
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:6819:236"/> underſtood by the whore;</hi> as Tertullian expoundeth in his booke againſt the Iewes, and in his third booke againſt Marcion. And Hierome in his 17. Epiſtle to Marcella, and Quaeſt. 11. to Algaſia. Bellarmine touching the Romane Pope, in his third booke, and in the thirteenth chapter. Here then wee have our adverſary confeſsing. What therfore letteth that they should not agree with us about the Antichriſt? They have invented a dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble crafty ſhift for themſelves, one <hi>of the place,</hi> an other <hi>of the time,</hi> of <hi>the place,</hi> that albeit Rome be the Whore, yet is it not the ſeate of Antichriſt, but Hieruſalem. Of <hi>the time,</hi> that Rome was the VVhore, when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours ruled, but now shee is not, ſince she became Chriſtian, and therfore that shee is not the ſeate of Antichriſt, ſeeing he shall not come but a little before the laſt iudgement. But the Papiſts are holden with their owne ſnares; for granting Rome to be the whore, they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo needs grant the reſt. Firſt of all, that not Hieruſalem, but shee is the ſeate of Antichriſt. For is not this Beaſt the very Antichriſt? This alſo Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine yeeldeth, and though he had not yeelded it, the truth wil force him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe it, as we shal ſee. But he affirmeth <hi>that Antichriſt ſhal hate Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> from v. 16. after, wel acknowledging that the Beaſt is Antichriſt: but how truly he ſpoke of hatred, wee shal examine at that place. From his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we have, that <hi>both the whore is Rome, &amp; the Beaſt Antichriſt.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which it is of neceſsity, that Antichriſt shal have his denne at Rome, ſeeing he is the very Beaſt, on which the whore is caried. Doth not the Spirit shew a ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry great coniunction &amp; nigh familiarity of both, <hi>of the whore</hi> in ſetting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; <hi>of the Beaſt</hi> in bearing? Ther is none but he wil ſay that a man is neerly joyned to the horſe on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſitteth. Certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly if Antichriſt was to raigne at Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Rome</hi> being ſet ſo farr fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſaddle, should walke on foot hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; baſe, who had ſo little aide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Emperours, after they removed to Byzantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher they were not farr. Secodly as touching the time, how abſurd is this diſtinction that the whore should be Heatheniſh Rome the firſt 300 yeeres after Chriſt; but that Antich. the Beaſt should not come u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til about 3. yeeres &amp; an halfe before the laſt day. Shal shee ſit on the Beaſt not yet borne, yea not conceived a very long time after. For shal the Beaſt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cometh beare the whore, being dead ſo many ages before? For the <hi>whore</hi> shal ceaſe to be 1300. yeeres, &amp; how much more we know not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antich. shal come. Theſe ar dreames &amp; wholly mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters <hi>of bearing &amp; ſit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The Spirit hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you al ſuch ſubterfuge, coupling theſe 2. things by ſo u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeparable a band, wherby he forbiddeth both to ſeeke Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chr. els wher then at <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; alſo to think her to be <hi>this whore</hi> at any other time, then when Antichriſt should have his ſeate there. Needs ar theſe two things to be ioyned togither, both in place &amp; time.</p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:6819:237"/>
               <p>But when shall this <hi>time</hi> beginne? for this yet hath ſome doubt. Surely when wee shall ſee the <hi>whore to have ben caried on this Beaſt;</hi> &amp; by his helpe, and authority placed in dignity, and lifted up on high VVhich though I holde my peace, Leo will confeſſe to have ben done in the 1. ſermon of the Nativity of the Apoſtles, when the preheminence came to the Popes, and Rome began to excell through the opinion of her religion. <hi>Rome,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>being made the head of the world, by the ſacred Chaire of S. Peter, hath more ample authority through divine religion, then earthly dominion. For although being inlarged by many victories, thou haſt extended the fraunches of thyne Empire by la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and by ſea, yet notwithſtanding it is leſſe, that which warrelike labour hath put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, then that which Chriſtian peace hath ſubdued.</hi> Likewiſe Proſper in his booke <hi>de ingratis:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Rome is of Peter the Seat which in honour Paſtoral</l>
                     <l>Is made of the world head, what by the right Martial</l>
                     <l>Shee doth not poſſeſſe, yet ſhee, by religion hold free.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Therfore this one common type miniſtreth a neceſſary argument, both of the ſeat and Kingdome of Antichriſt: which alone might be ſufficient to take away all controverſie; were it not that men loved themſelves more then the truth, and would not ceſſe to barke againſt it, till that their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes be altogither ſtopped. VVherfore the Spirit ſtayeth not here, but go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth on yet to clearer things, that for whom the morning light is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, they may have the Noone Sunne an helper, if peradventure they wil then ſee. The ſitting being in ſuch wiſe declared peculiarly, afterward he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcendeth to both, and firſt to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which is deſcribed by the <hi>colour, names of blaſphemy, heads, and hornes. The colour is of skarlet,</hi> made readde by the little worme Coccus. VVherfore this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is honourable, shining with the ſame colour with Kings: and no leſſe wicked and bloody. For this ſame colour is attibuted to moſt grievous ſines: <hi>Yf your ſinns were as skarlet,</hi> ſayth Iſaiah chap. 1.18. Not onely becauſe it is a deep colour which cannot be washed of: but cheifly for the cruelty of ſhedding blood; which wickednes among the reſt ſeemeth moſt horrible. VVo ſeeth not that this <hi>Beaſt is at Rome,</hi> where the Pope ſitteth, whoſe feete Kings doe kiſſe; and who doth moſt cruelly murder Chriſtians, not acknowledging his divine power both in the city and alſo through all the Dominion? But that colour hath not pleaſed chiefly the Romish Court at all adventures; which hath come to paſſe by the providence of God, that the Fathers might ſet before the world a viſible shew of this <hi>skarlet coloured Beaſt.</hi> Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which thing ſee a moſt fine Epigrame of Theod. Beza. Secondly, <hi>this Beaſt is full of names of Blaſphemy.</hi> How fruitful an increaſe of a naughty
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:6819:237"/> thing? Long agoe <hi>the heads did beare the names of blaſphemy,</hi> chap. 13.1. now the <hi>whole body</hi> is full of the ſame. And firſt of all the <hi>Primacy</hi> was chiefely a blaſphemy; and therfore it was well carried on the head, but the time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded dayly others, the heape whereof grew every day, until at length they came to the Councill of Trent, and Maſters of controverſies, by whoſe pai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes now the whole <hi>Beaſt</hi> is ſo covered with moſt wicked errours (the whol ſea of doctrine being turned into deadly blood, as hath ben ſayd in chap. 16.3.) that thou canſt ſee noe place free from ſome newe blaſphemy. Let an indifferent iudge conſider ſo many horrible errours as in three great vo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lumes Bellarmine deffendeth by the <hi>Popes</hi> approbation, and let him ſpeak ſincerely, whether every haire almoſt of this Beaſt is not ſpotted with ſom notable blaſphemy. Thirdly <hi>he hath ſeven heads and tenne hornes:</hi> of which, what is the meaning, the interpretation wil declare, which the Angel will make by and by. In the meane time let it be agreed of, that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is the ſame, which wee ſaw in the thirteenth chapter, and to be the <hi>former</hi> of the two. For of the <hi>ſecond</hi> are rehearſed onely <hi>two hornes,</hi> there in the 11. verſe: he maketh mention but of one in this place, becauſe both make but one Antichriſt, as in the chapter even now ſpoken of we have shewed: and of the <hi>former</hi> onely, becauſe it is his intent to ſet before our eyes whole <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> from his firſt original, of whom the <hi>ſecond Beaſt</hi> repreſenteth onely the half figure; but now becauſe in the laſt times, in which the Beaſt ſhould be fully diſcovered, <hi>Rome the whore</hi> should depend more upon the civill au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority of the Pope, of which that firſt is the type, then upon the ſpiritual; we ſee at this day, that the patrimony of Peter avayleth more, then the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine, which they faine to be Paules; that neither Spaine, nor France, nor others very many have any regard to Rome, but in ſo much as her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſerveth for their profit. There is no man but knoweth that Italy deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth her now a long time at home, howſoever shee hath ben content to ſuffer her to be worshipped of ſtrangers like a God. For theſe cauſes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>former Beaſt</hi> onely is ſet forth. Frances de Ribera the Ieſuite avou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth that this Beaſt is not that of the 13. chapter, but a new &amp; new firſt ſeen. Why ſo I pray? becauſe <hi>no article,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is prefixed before Woman, or Beaſt, as it is wont to be done in things known.</hi> Certenly if he should conclude from the new forme, wherein they now firſt appeare, it might have ſome weight which he ſayth; but ſeeing he gathereth that therfore neither of them was ſimply and abſolutely before, becauſe they were not ſeen before in this forme, to which <hi>onely</hi> thing, the defect of the article hath reſpect; he dealeth either fooliſhly, or fraudulently, after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the Ieſuits. <hi>So J ſaw,</hi> ſaith Iohn, <hi>ond behold a Lambe ſtood upon mount Sion,</hi> chap. 14.1.
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:6819:238"/> where alſo the article is wanting. Is this therfore a new Lambe? If any should ſay that there was new forme of <hi>him ſtanding upon mount Sion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with and hundred fourty and foure thouſand,</hi> he should ſay nothing contrary to the truth: but it is the ſame Lambe in very truth, of which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion was made before, chap. 5. After the ſame manner a new shew is here brought in, not a new perſon, as is manifeſt in the woman; which being called in the firſt verſe a <hi>whore,</hi> had the emphaſis of the articles, which did manifeſt the olde whore. So now the ſame comming forth in a new dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, wanteth the ſame articles. The <hi>woman</hi> then and the whore are al one; and this Beaſt is the ſame with that in the thirteenth chapter, <hi>having the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſeate, blaſphemy, heads, hornes, worſhip among men, the cauſe of the like eternal deſtruction, and partaker of all his properties:</hi> unleſſe that ſome of them should now be more increaſed in proceſſe of time, and all things under this fift vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al more evident, then they were when they began. For now he appeareth full of that blaſphemy, which before poſſeſſed the <hi>heads</hi> onely. And was that former Beaſt Antichriſt; and shal not this be hee, which is more blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous? The <hi>wonderers</hi> alſo at whom, are no leſſe reprobates, then they that wondered at that? VVhat shal the Ieſuite then gaine, if that former being ſent away to Hieruſalem, he hath left this more pernitious Beaſt at Rome?</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And the woman was arayed with purple and skarlet:</hi> Such is the Beaſt: now of what quality the woman is, whom we shal ſee adorned moſt ſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly: of which thing Tertullian ſpake wittily: <hi>Who hath deſerved the name of an harlot at the Lords hande; ſhee is made equal to her name in her attire. Shee ſitteth verily in purple, with skarlet, and gold, and pretious ſtone, which are curſed, without which a curſed woman and harlot could not be deſcribed.</hi> Theſe things ſpake he, but peradventure ſomewhat too ſeverely, in his booke concerning woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s apparell.</p>
               <p>The attire is altogither Princely, and belonging to triumphes, ſuch as Belſhazzar promiſeth to them that should read the writting, ſaying, <hi>He ſhalbe clothed with Purple, with a Chaine of Golde about his necke, and ſhalbe the third Ruler in the Kingdome,</hi> Daniell chapter fift verſe ſeventh. Attire ſurely fit for her, which <hi>raigneth over the Kings of the earth,</hi> as after in the 18. ver. But purple was ſufficient for dignity: To what ende is there alſo skarlet? That it might note out great cruelty ioined togither with it. Shee is of the ſame diſpoſition with the Beaſt redde with the murthers of the faithfull, in the twelve Chapter and third verſe. There are many Cities made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for their notable cruelty: but togither therewith the dwelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Antichriſt ought to flourish in exceeding great Maieſtie, which
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:6819:238"/> might be diſcerned from all the reſt. Both which victories even the Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes themſelves cannot deny to be due to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is added alſo <hi>Gold, Pretious ſtones and Perles;</hi> which beſide the Maieſtie, note alſo moſt exceſsive riot: which is an other token of this <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And who can recken the infinite coſtes of this City, beſtowed on <hi>Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Theatres, Galleries, hote Bathes, Palaces, Obeliskes, Pillars, Arches belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to triumphes, Private houſes,</hi> and other ornaments? Into this one City, hath bin laid up in ſtore the glory of the whole world, taken from very ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other: to let paſſe auncient things, what an huge ſumme of mony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed of late Pope Sixtus the fift, in the yeer one thouſand five hundreth foure ſcore and eight, upon a conduit which he built on the mount Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? It is recorded that two hundred and threeſcore thouſand crounes were ſpent upon this thing. Neither did any neceſsity wring from him this charges, but that the Pope might ſommer the more pleaſantly in that mountaine. The Vaticane Library renewed of the ſame Pope, ſcarſe perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture ſtood him of leſſe. Yet notwithſtanding the ſame man brought fifty hundred thouſand peeces of Gold into a new treaſury, which he ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Caſtle of Sainct Angel, that thou mayeſt underſtand that the Popes are not yet brought to beggerie. But this <hi>Gold</hi> &amp; <hi>pretious ſtones</hi> doo not onely ſeeme riots; (for <hi>Rome</hi> hath bene farre more riotous, and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in former times, then at this day: but to what ende should he caſt in her teeth now her immoderate decking, of which he ſpake nothing when it exceeded by many degrees?) but alſo to be tokens, to whoſe riches ſhee should leane in theſe laſt times: for wee shall ſee after in the eighteen chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter and two and twentith verſe, that this <hi>Purple, Skarlet, Gold, Pretious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; Pearles,</hi> conſiſt in thoſe wares, wherby Spaine is ſignified.</p>
               <p>Therefore let this braverie be to this end, to shew that Rome shal moſt of all glory in the aide of the Spaniards, at what time the <hi>vial</hi> ſhalbe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out on the Throne of the Beaſt. Otherwiſe the Spirit would have me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tionned the former ages, when her cloathing was more ſumptuous and exquiſite.</p>
               <p>And whither is not SPAINE at this day, and hath not bene alſo ſince CHARLES the fift, the cheife upholder of Rome, leaning as readie to fall?</p>
               <p>If any peradventure knoweth not theſe things, let him know at length the things to be ſo by the teſtimony of the Pope Clement the eight, governing at this day the Romish Church, who of late in the yeere one thouſand five hundred and nintie ſixe, being about the creating of ſome newe CARDINALS, proteſted openly before, that although
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:6819:239"/> 
                  <hi>he did this creation of his owne proper motion, yet that he had not ben able to deny this duty to the King of Spaine, but that he ſhould create ſome Spanirads, becauſe he is the ſtay of Catholike religion: to whom in this decrepite age that was not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but rather we ought to gratify and content him in this thing,</hi> as Ianſonius doth relate en his Italiques. This therfore is the reaſon of the adorning proper to this time, whereat Iohn wondreth, as if it were new, as after in ver. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Shee had a golden cup in her hand:,</hi> Now the fowleneſſe of her diſhoneſty is revealed, which is twofold, one which shee uſeth towards <hi>men known &amp; more famous,</hi> whom shee ſpeaketh to as it were by name, and reacheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cup of her fornication: the other regardeth thoſe <hi>that are unknowne,</hi> whom shee allureth by the name written in her forehead in the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. For shee deſireth that no man should avoide her ſnares. <hi>Shee com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth forth with a cup,</hi> as a fit inſtrument of her luſt, as once at Rome everie one carryed a token of that trade which he practiſed. For the Spirit hath made mention before <hi>of the wine of her fornication:</hi> and drunkeneſſe &amp; glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony are moſt apt ſtirrers up of luſt. From whence the whore in Salomon <hi>extolleth her prepared dainties,</hi> Proverb. 7.14. Shee hath therfore this cup in her hand, reached out to moſt famous Kings and Princes, to whom ſhee ſendeth Ambaſſadours, Cardinals, Ieſuits, and other uncleane Spirits of that ſorte, who may draw them in and retaine them in the fellowſhip of the <hi>Romiſh Idolatry.</hi> In which thing the moſt vehement deſire of Rome is known, which ſpareth no, either labour or coaſt, ſo that shee may by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery allure them to this wicked ſociety with her. Which that ſhee may be able to doo the more eaſily, <hi>the cup is golden,</hi> very pretious without, and in the eſtimation of men; the Romiſh impietie being ſet forth with all po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe of wordes, by conſent, multitude, antiquity, perpetual ſucceſsion, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chaire of Peter, and ſuch faire painting, wherby it may ſeeme more pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious then any gold to the unskilfull. But within, <hi>this cup is full of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and filthines of fornications,</hi> that is, if the doctrine be tryed and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cut to the quicke, nothing is ſo filthy, but the fowleneſſe of this will ſurmount it. For to expreſſe this horrible filthines, the Spirit hath cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſen that kinde of diſhoneſty, which blushing ſuffereth not ſpeake. In one word this whore is of this kinde of Heretiques called <hi>Borboritae,</hi> of whom ſee Epiphanius in Panario, and Oecumenius on Inda.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>And in her forehead a name written:</hi> An other kinde of filthines, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by shee carrieth written in her forehead moſt impudently, that shee is a common harlot. Shee would not have any man to paſſe by unknown and uncalled, but from the inſcription to know where he may turne into a
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:6819:239"/> whore. It can ſcarce be ſpoken of how monſtrous luſt thoſe little <hi>ſacring belles, and ſance belles of the ſtewes</hi> were inſtruments, which this ſame <hi>whore Rome</hi> uſed long ſince; as Socrates declareth in book 5. chap. 18. But this name written paſſeth that impudency. For they were ſilent ſome time, and ſufferred the ſenſe to reſt from the foule provoquer: this inſcription giveth no reſt to the eyes, alwayes running upon them and provoking unto diſho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſty. Therfore apparell is not inough for her to declare her profeſsion, u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe alſo this ſigne on the forehead be joyned with it, which Ivie buſh ſhould make her wine vendible. O impudency! The <hi>whores</hi> before time were covered with a vaile; thou in thy forehead diſcovereth, &amp; a tittle w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritten upon it manifeſteth thy diſhoneſty. But what is this name? Not this word <hi>Myſterie,</hi> as it ſeemeth, which Aretas joyneth with the word <hi>written,</hi> without any diſtinction of a comma in this manner: <hi>And upon her forhead a name written a Myſterie: great Babylon &amp;c.</hi> As if the word <hi>a Myſterie</hi> were the abſtract, inſtead of the concrete <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Myſticall,</hi> as though he should ſay, and upon her forehead a myſticall name written, Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. Surely this ſyntaxe requireth that a noune ioyned with a noune without an article, should paſſe into the place of the predicate, as they ſpeake. As, and in the forehead a name written, which is a myſtery. From which it is manifeſt that the word Myſterie is not to be written with a great letter in the beginning, as if it were a part of the name, and the marke of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, but to be read togither with thoſe thinges, which goe before. But the meaning is all one, teaching that a certaine myſterie lyeth hid in this name, which is otherwiſe to be expounded, then it sheweth outwardly. Wherfore the name written on the forehead is the whole period of theſe words: <hi>Babylon that great, that mother of fornications and abominations of the earth.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, that no City doth vaunt ſo to be in expreſſe words. Neither doth the Spirit ſay ſo, but declareth that this is her true name, which Iohn ſaw written on her forehead, in ſo many letters and ſyllables, howſoever the true Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should have a name writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on it, which should ſignify this ſame thing in other words by a myſtery, to wit, <hi>the Empreſſe Rome, the Pillar of trueth, a looking glaſſe and paterne of all Churches, from whoſe ſtatutes, whatſoever ſhee ordaineth, wee muſt by no meanes departe:</hi> Diſtinct. 19. Enimvero. This is that name painted with great letters on the whores for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: whoſe meaning if thou shalt ſearch diligently, thou shalt ſee that by a myſtery it cometh to the ſame end, to which that did which Iohn ſaw. For whatſoever auncient corruption either hath ben long agoe, or is yet left in theſe our Weſterne and Northerne Churches, all that floweth from <hi>Rome:</hi> in which reſpect shee vaunteth that shee is the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:6819:240"/> or rather the <hi>ſtepmother,</hi> which hath mixed deadly hemlocke to her daughters. Such then is this name, which yet notwithſtanding remaineth myſtical in this laſt period, as the Spirit sheweth manifeſtly, prefixing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it the word <hi>Myſtery.</hi> And therfore neither ſhall it now be manifeſt to all men, as wee may ſee in the Papiſts who doo worship this name as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines to the Lord.</hi> The Ieſuits <hi>confeſſe</hi> by conſtraint, that <hi>this Babylon is their Rome,</hi> as a little before we have ſeen: yet what windings and turnings in &amp; out doo they ſeeke, wherby the Popiſh turpitude and impiety may vanish away? Bellarmine will have the Heathen Rome to be meant, ſuch as it was once under the Emperours that were enemies to the name of Chriſt. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces de Ribera would rather <hi>that a future time ſhould be regarded, when by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> as he dreameth, <hi>the Pope ſhould be driven from Rome.</hi> So are they blinded in this name, which ſoundeth any thing to them, rether then that which the thing is. But we have shewed ſufficiently, that theſe inventions are no leſſe foolish, then pernitious to the embracers of them: and the things that follow in this very chapter, will make it more manifeſt; that no other Babylon is here mentioned then the <hi>Rome belonging to the Popes at this preſent time,</hi> and as it hath bene for many ages paſt. Did the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours labour to impoſe the <hi>Romane Idolatry</hi> on the conquered nations? Or if they had ſtrove to doo it, should this impietie have had any myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? It was playne that the Heatheniſh ſuperſtition was deteſtable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; but this Babylon should infect Chriſtians by the contagion of her ſuperſtition, which thing cannot belong to any other <hi>Rome,</hi> then that of the Popes. But let it be to come, and let the Pope be driven from thence, and let all impiety come on with force openly, which ô Ribera thou muſt neceſſarily grant. Where then shalbe this <hi>Myſterie.</hi> VVho can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your great naughtineſſe joyned with impudency? Therefore, that which you imagine, abhorreth all likelyhood of truth.</p>
               <p>Therefore Babylon is <hi>that ROME, which ſhould deceive her people with an outward ſhewe of godlines, which ſhould be counted a Holy City, and ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the uttermoſt Court,</hi> as wee have shewed in the eleventh chapter, verſes firſt and ſecond: which unleſſe it nowe <hi>deceived you Papiſts,</hi> I should not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge her to be <hi>Babylon:</hi> but your, either witting or ignorant obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, maketh the trueth of the Prophecy cleare. Let us take up from hence that which the very words doo yeeld us manifeſtly: <hi>That the Whore ſhall not make warre againſt Chriſt openly, but ſhall fight againſt him privily and ſecretly, through a Myſterie.</hi> Which thing, what force it hath to finde out Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, wee shall fee after.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>And J ſaw that woman drunken with the blood of the Saincts &amp;c.</hi> The third

Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the beginning being made, how much Chriſtian blood shed the wicked Emperours afterward? VVhatſoever ſlaughter was any where through the whole world almoſt, that came eyther from her commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, or exhortation and approbation. It cannot be ſpoken, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and how great warres the horrible Popes ſtirred up in the times follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſetting all the Kings of Europe togither by the eares. And beſide the ſlaughters of publike warres, how many holy men loſt their life, becauſe they agreed not with Rome? VVho were banished as Heretiques, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with the torments of the flames. Shee continueth at this day in the ſame ſtepps, which not long agoe in the yeere 1595. at length burnt alive a certaine English man for ſmiting to the ground out of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the Archbishop of Ambronen, their ſacrilegious ſacrifice of the altar, after his right hand cut off, and the reſt of his body, being drawen through the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was burned by the tormenters in ſundry places with burning torches. Beholde, I pray you ô English men, whither you flee, thither aſſuredly, where ſo great impiety raigneth; that if ſo be there be any ſeed of electjon in you, yee would rather die a thouſand deaths, then beare with it by your ſilence. Is not the ſame Rome at this day the shoppe of rebellions, the pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce where Chriſtian Princes are tormented? Certenly this aſſembly of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doth firſt decree the murthers of Princes, and then ſendeth by ſtealt Ieſuites privie murtherers and poiſonners: who execute the ſame after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they deſire. It were an infinite thing O Rome, to recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up all thy butcheries. <hi>Thou art drunken ſurely with blood,</hi> tumbling thy ſelfe in thy ſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fet, which thou haſt ſpued out through exceeding much devouring. Now then all theſe common properties ioyned togither, doo shew unto us ſuch a <hi>whore,</hi> to weet, <hi>augmented, upheld, by the Beaſt, Princely, rich, gay. that great Mother Citie, and ſpirituall Babylon, the authour of allſuperſtitions, yet deceiving craftily by her vaine ſhewes, and finally a cruell Martyrs-murtherer:</hi> which all, if togither they can be found no where elſe, ſaving in Rome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; let us acknowledge that damnable Citie, and let every one betimes provide, that her ſociety hurt them not. leaſt he perish togither in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that shall come shortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And I wondered:</hi> Hitherto the <hi>typicall</hi> deſcription; now he paſſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>interpretation,</hi> the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof is related in theſe words.

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:6819:241"/> But the wicked have in admiration and wonder at the ſame woman with a certaine reverence, from an opinion of a certaine excellency, even as they are ſayd to wonder after the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in chap. 13.3. But whither was he igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Beaſt which he ſaw in the thirteenth chapter? In no wiſe: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he ſaid to wonder at <hi>the Beaſt alone,</hi> but at <hi>the woman ioyned with it,</hi> both which he had not ſeen before in this new forme, and whole apparell. And who would not be abashed at this, that the <hi>Dragons</hi> throne, which Iohn ſaw after the Dragon was thruſt out, in ſome ſorte become the sheep fold of the Lord, had ben able againe to clime up to this heigh of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p n="7">7 <hi>Then the Angel ſaid unto me, wherfore marveileſt thou?</hi> The interrogation hath a certaine blaming of negligence and unskilfulnes; as though he should ſay, unleſſe men had shamefully deſpiſed the obſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of former times, now they should not have had need to wonder at the Whore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw her flourishing in this whatſoever felicity. But the merciful father, who pardoneth all ſinnes to his children for Chriſts ſake, forgiveth alſo this careleſnes. And therfore he ſendeth his Angsl, to make the whol thing moſt plaine. For this is that which followeth, <hi>I wil ſhew thee the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp;c.</hi> yet warning, not darkely, that alſo the interpretation it ſelfe shall not be cleare to all men, but shal remaine yet hidden to all that are harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as before at verſe 3. &amp; 5.</p>

Therfore this Beaſt is not properly the Devil,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:6819:241"/> as ſome of the auncient Fathers expound it; and the Ieſuite Ribera ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it greedily. Of him it could not be ſaid, <hi>that he was not yet come,</hi> or <hi>that he had not yet received power:</hi> whoſe Kingdome then both flourished ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry greatly, and did flourish before Chriſt came in the flesh. Afterward we shall ſee, that the original of this Beaſt is to be ſet at that time, wherein the Dragon was thruſt <hi>out of heaven, and gave him his Throne.</hi> And ſo there are two and fourty moneths of his cheife power, which ſame is the ſpace of the woman lying hid in the wilderneſſe, and of the two Prophets cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in ſackcloth. Theſe chapters 13.5. and 12.6. and 11.2. will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſame beginning to all theſe. Which wee have shewed to have falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the times of the beginning of the raigne of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantine the Great</hi> ſome ages after, that Iohn was dead. After which beginning the firſt part noteth, that there was a time when the Beaſt flourished for a ſeaſon, to weet, at the end of the publike perſecutions by open enemies, whom the proweſſe of Conſtantine put to flight. <hi>The ſecond,</hi> that after that proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tranquility, a new tempeſt aroſe, which afflicted the Beaſt ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, that for iuſt cauſe men should ſay, <hi>that he was in time paſt, but that now he is not,</hi> as whom they should thinke to have perished utterly in thoſe troubles, as it came to paſſe, after that refreshing under ſome fewe Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours, (in which time the authority of the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> increaſed marvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly,) when the invaſion of the Barbarous people ſpoyled miſerably all Italy; cruelly deſtroyed Rome it ſelfe, <hi>the Throne of the Beaſt;</hi> and did cut off almoſt to the very roote, the authority of the Pope, growing too ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely. Should not men then have cryed out by right, that <hi>the Pope was,</hi> but <hi>is not:</hi> whoſe not onely authority, but alſo ſeate, they might thinke to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve ben altogither paſt recovery? This <hi>ſecond time was caled the wounded head,</hi> in chap. 13.3. which did bring with it, the knowledge of the former, of which there could be no knowledg, until this alteration had befalle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the Beaſt lay not alway in this deſtruction; he roſe out of it againe, as <hi>the third member</hi> declareth, <hi>he came out of the bottomleſſe pit:</hi> which came to paſſe, when he lifted up his head againe, after that Barbarian ſtorme of adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was mitigated. This time comprehendeth both the curing of the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by <hi>Iuſtinian and Phocas;</hi> and alſo his riſing out of the earth, or out of the bottomleſſe pit by <hi>Gregory the ſecond;</hi> of both which in chap. 13.3.11. &amp; 11.7. and 9.2.11. This Gregory exerciſed that power, which his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours had obtayned of the Emperours, yea a farre greater: not onely as an <hi>Vniverſall Bishop,</hi> but as the higheſt Dictatour, taking away and giving the Empire to whom he thought good. It is ſufficient in this place to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the firſt beginning of things. Who firſt beſtowed the name of an Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:6819:242"/> upon men in the Weſt part, wee have shewed in an other place. Therfore the Beaſt aſcended then, when the <hi>Popes</hi> had gotten this terrene power to themſelves, as in chap. 13.11. hath ben ſayd; which earth he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here the bottomleſſe pit; as elſwhere in the Pſalmiſt; <hi>and makeſt me to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the depthes of the earth:</hi> Pſal. 71.20. And ſo is the <hi>third time.</hi> The <hi>fourth</hi> is, <hi>ſhall goe into deſtruction,</hi> which declareth that this dignity revived ſhall not remaine for ever; but be diminished by little and little, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurly conſumed, while it be at length utterly abolished: as wee have heard before in the ſecond chapter of <hi>Jezabell lying ſicke in her bedde,</hi> the paramour of this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>languiſhing of an incurable conſumption.</hi> Even as at this daie, thankes be to God, wee ſee in Rome, and in the Pope: but the buriall, &amp; funeralls are yet to come: about what time, the Revelation will shew us af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are the foure notable changins, wherby the <hi>Beaſt</hi> might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come known to men being not blind willingly; from which wee have a moſt ſtrong argument to prove both the time, when <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>whore,</hi> &amp; <hi>of the perſon of Antichriſt.</hi> For that <hi>City</hi> is the <hi>whore,</hi> in which reigneth <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> to weet, the very <hi>Beaſt which was, which is not, which aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit, and goeth into deſtruction.</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>the City,</hi> in which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>¶ And the Inhabitans of the earth ſhall wonder:</hi> In giving all honour and ſervice to him, being aſtonied with the renowne of his falſe dignity: which before was ſayd, <hi>to wonder after the Beaſt,</hi> chap. 13.3, Yet notwithſtanding leaſt wee should thinke, that all men should be caryed away into this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he numbreth among this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany <hi>the inhabitans</hi> onely <hi>of the earth;</hi> to weet, the citizens of the falſe Church, <hi>whoſe names are not written in the book of life.</hi> O good God how much concerneth it you ô yee Papiſts, to deliver your Pope from all likeneſſe to this Beaſt? If he be found covered
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:6819:242"/> with his hide, which this chapter will make more cleare then the light at noone tide, you are utterly loſt; unleſſe you ſhall flee very quickly all fellow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhippe with him. I pray you, as you regarde your owne ſalvation, that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide all hatred, preiudice, and bitterneſſe of mindes, you weigh the matter with mee in equal ballances. A great matter is in hande, either the vantage or loſſe of eternall life. See you not that the Pope and the Beaſt, did tread in the ſame ſteppes alwayes, even hitherto? Attend to thoſe things which follow; wee finde both of them to walke in the ſame path, which the Spirit hath marked out, with equall paſes and hand in hand. But you will cry out that this is a new interpretation: yet appointe not the Spirit at your pleaſure; he ſtiſtributeth moſt wiſely, according to his pleaſure, a meaſure of knowledge to every time. Rather regard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the whole Prophecy, which will yeeld a moſt cleare proofe of the truth; and eſteeme that moſt auncient, which you shall finde true. VVhy doo yee ſuffer your ſelves to be deceived with the names of them, whom the moſt certen event declareth to have bene verie greatly deceived in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many things <hi>of this Revelation.</hi> This is the notable craft of <hi>the Ieſuites</hi> to call foorth cheifly thoſe witneſſes, and Interpreters, by whoſe reverend i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorance, they may cover and hid the impiety <hi>of the Pope:</hi> there was not ſo much danger from him, to thoſe auncient Fathers, living eyther before <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> or by and by after his beginning.</p>
               <p>They underſtood ſufficiently, that which perteined unto them; other things, God would have to be wrapped in darkeneſſe, while the fore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time should come, that the reprobat ſeing might not ſee, &amp; a way ſo be made ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his decree: awake yee therfor at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your eyes to the ſhining truth, which if yee shall behold gliſtering more clearly, then that it can be obſcured by falſe remote calumnies; remember that <hi>thoſe are not written in the booke of life, which have the Beaſt in great admiration:</hi> &amp; then take adviſe, according to the greatneſſe of the thing. You alſo my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (for ſo I eſteeme you, as long as any hope remayneth,) I would admoniſh in a few wordes, who through lightneſſe of minde &amp; deſire of novelty, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin two or three dayes ſpace, become Papiſts. It ſeemeth a paſtime to you caſting away the truth, to fall to the Pope, but take heed that in your ſport yee periſh not in earneſt. And willingly wipe your names out of the book of life. You prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that you will be <hi>Catholikes,</hi> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that whom you hold for <hi>Catholiks,</hi> are <hi>reprobates,</hi> unleſſe they ſhall eſcape at length fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe tents, into which yee fly for ſalvation. But theſe pretenſes of ſalvation are toies. I know what grieveth you, eyther want, or diſhonour at home, or a greater reputation of other men.

               <p>What diſhonour can be greater, then to be added in the company of caſt awayes? Or who hath not honour inough which is counted <hi>the childe of God?</hi> Minde, I pray you, theſe things, &amp; ſuch like, and think it not a light matter, forſaking the true God, to aſſociate your ſelves with the Divill. Behold alſo what miſchievous perſons yee doo nourish in your boſome, who gladly doo intertaine the Ieſuits. He which ioyneth you to the friend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship of the Pope, procureth unto you certen and undoubted deſtruction. How miſerable a thing is it, with the hazzard of this life, to ſeeke an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted loſſe of eternall life?

Now the ſame kind of ſpeaking noteth out the eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them that shalbe ſaved. Which two things are moſt neerely cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled togither.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>and is preſent.</hi> The difference is, that thoſe ſignify, that the Beaſt remaineth alive in the very deſtruction, as though he should ſay; although in mens opinion <hi>he is not,</hi> yet he is: and ſo both members are referred to the ſame time, as before Iohn ſaw <hi>one of his heads as it were wounded to death,</hi> which yet was not wholly killed in chap. 13. The other reading noteth out more plai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely the third time, in which after the hurt endured, the Beaſt should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; which thing Aretas, the Complutent edition, and other copies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh plainely, which reade <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and ſhall be preſent:</hi> and as Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius tranſlated, <hi>ſhall come.</hi> Yet that former reading of Theod. Beza may ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the ſame ſence; albeit in mens opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> of late was not, yet now he is. In which ſenſe they are to be taken, that they may have reſpect to the Beaſt comming forth from calamity, not continuing in the ſame. For they are anſwerable to the third diſtinct <hi>time</hi> in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> as is cleare from the men admiring the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> who admire not the ſame contemned and afflicted, (which should
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:6819:243"/> be neceſſary, if the words reſpected the ſame time with the member going next before,) but recovering his dignity contrary to mens expectation, and the ſame greater then he had before; as it came to paſſe in his third change, after he was recovered of his wound, chap. 13.3. Wherfore the vulgar Latine reading corruptly, paſſeth over this third member, making men to wonder at the <hi>Beaſt</hi> when he is not: which is contrary to the truth of the thing. Furthermore, it is certaine, that it is not to be read in the future tence, but in the preſent: becauſe admiration belongeth not to a fu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, but to a preſent dignity. From which let us obſerve, what wondring, is a token of reprobation, to weet, of <hi>a Beaſt reviving after the hurt received, which is the ſecond Beaſt,</hi> in chap. 15.11. Even until that time he was not ſo deſperately impious, but that he might eaſily deceive the Saincts: but at length he came to that naughtineſſe, that he muſt be banished from the Kingdome of God, who will acknowledg him to be ſuch an one by admyring, as he profeſſeth himſelfe to be. But wheras the <hi>Angel</hi> in theſe words, proſecuteth not his variable condition beyond the third time, therby he sheweth, that he ſhalbe openly knowne to the world before his laſt ende ſhall come.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Here is the mind:</hi> Thus farre the <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath bin shewed us according to <hi>his whole;</hi> now he entreth into the interpretation of ſome <hi>chiefe parts:</hi> wherunto he prepareth himſelfe a way by this Preface. Which yet is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, whither it is to be referred to that which went before, or to this which followeth: it ſeemeth being ſet in the midſt, to have reſpect to both alike, for to cauſe attention. The ſpeach ſeemeth defective, and to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed after the manner of that in chap. 13.18. <hi>Here is wiſdome, let him that hath wit, count &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>here is wit, let him that hath wiſdome underſtand:</hi> as in the Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches, <hi>let him that hath eares, heare:</hi> or it may be a perfit ſentence of it ſelfe, <hi>here is the minde that hath wiſdome;</hi> as though he should ſay, conſider the foreſaid chaunges: likewiſe conſider the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; the underſtanding of which things is true wiſdome indeede, wherby a man may avoide eternall deſtruction. But theſe are the wordes not onely of exhortation, but alſo of Prophecie, which declare that in the moſt open light, in which the Beaſt shalbe ſet, every one shall not acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge him, but they onely who are endued with wiſedome, and have their eyes inlightened of God. The Beaſt is like in this thing <hi>to the whore,</hi> whoſe name written in her forehead was a <hi>myſterie,</hi> which ſhould be hidden from very many, no leſſe then ſome obſcure and inexplicable riddle. For Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies fulfilled become not manifeſt to all men, as we wil after shew that Bellarmine triſleth, but unto ſome certaine men, to whom it is given to
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:6819:244"/> underſtand, the reſt remaining in their former blindnes. Which ſhort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, confuteth a threefold errour of the Papiſts, <hi>one touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name Antichriſt: the other, of the doctrine: the third of the publique perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> of which wee will ſpeake more at large, in the refutation at the ende of the Chapter.</p>

But underſtand Ribera, <hi>that the ſeven mountaines belong to the city of Rome alone: But that thoſe ſeven Kings appertaine to the ſame city, to which the mountaines. For the heads are both mountaines and Kings, and therefore that theſe Kings belong to Rome alone:</hi> ſo doo we free thee from the great labour of ſeeking; proving by a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine argument, that he is found at Rome; to finde whom, thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paſſed all landes in vaine. But the time is ſpent to no profit in confuting thy toies, which yet I could not paſſe over wholly, but would admoniſh the Papiſts at leaſt by this ſmall labour, that they should not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be deceived any longer by the triſles of the Ieſuites. The thing it ſelfe is thus. Theſe dominions are proper to that city, whereunto belong the mountaines, &amp; the ſeven regiments are thoſe, by which the citie hath ben no leſſe famous, then for her ſeven mountaines. And Cornelius Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in the beginning of his hiſtory nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth theſe regiments in this wiſe: Kings held the City of Rome at the firſt: L. Brutus inſtituted freedome, &amp; the Conſulshippe: the Dictatourſhippes were taken up for a time: neither continued the power of the office of the Decemviri, above two yeeres, nor the Tribunes authority pertaining to Conſuls, was of force any long time &amp;c. The power of Pompey and Craſſus went quickly to Ceſar. By which wordes he declareth plainely, that ſixe kindes of government had held at Rome, from the building of the City even unto his time, <hi>Kings, Conſulls, Dictatours, Decemviri, Tribunes, of the ſouldiers, Emperours:</hi> the ſeventh of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes he knew not, being taken away from the living before he could ſee it.</p>

                  <hi>¶ Five are fallen: Kings, Conſuls, Dictatours, Decemviri, Tribunes:</hi> For thoſe five kinds of ruling had ceaſed wholly and vanished away before Iohn his time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ One is:</hi> the <hi>ſixt</hi> kinde of governing by <hi>Emperours,</hi> in whoſe power was the chiefe rule of things when Iohn lived,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And an other is not yet come: The ſeventh King, the Pope,</hi> was not yet a Governour of Rome, when the Apoſtle lived. And not without cauſe hath he shunned the adjective of order: for he ſaith not, <hi>the ſeventh is not yet come,</hi> but <hi>an other is not yet come,</hi> by the ſame ſignifying that <hi>this ſeventh</hi> ſhalbe very greatly unlike the former. All theſe were Political Kings; the <hi>ſeventh</hi> should be ſpiritual; or of a mixt kinde, unlike to every one before; from whence it is manifeſt that the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperours are not the <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th King.</hi> For they differred nothing in civill governement from the former, onely they tooke unto them the Chriſtian religion. And in auncient times new religions were often added; the forme of governement in the meane time nothing altered. Furthermore the <hi>ſeventh King</hi> ought to governe in the ſame place, where the <hi>ſeven mountaines</hi> are, as hath bene declared in the former verſe. But the Chriſtian Emperours never had the ſeate of their Empire <hi>at Rome;</hi> But the whole uſe of the citie was the Popes; from whom alone after the <hi>ſeventh King</hi> began, her glorie did grow. That member <hi>is not yet come,</hi> teacheth that there was a very short time remaining to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>of the ſeventh King.</hi> For ſo we are wonte to ſpeake of things that will come not very long after. Therefore foolish is Ribera the Ieſuite, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth the ſixt kind of governing after the comming of Chriſt, even unto three yeeres and an halfe more or leſſe before the laſt day, and together with him all the Paſtiſts, who will not have Antichriſt to be expected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſame very time; as though the Angel ſaying <hi>is not yet come,</hi> should ſpeake of a man, whom the world yet ſeeth not after a thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres.</p>

But now the caſe being altered in the firſt riſing up of Antichriſt, the chiefe Empire should be in an other place, then at Rome, as we know it came to paſſe when the Chriſtian Emperours lived at Byzantium, or Millane, or Ravenna, who retained in their owne power the chiefe ſoveraignty over the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world. For hetherto they ſpake as Lords, <hi>We, becauſe thou art a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an, have iudged thee worthy of the Biſhoprick of our City,</hi> as Conſtantius ſayd to Liberius the Bishop of Rome, Theod. book 2. chap. 16. Yea ſome ages
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:6819:248"/> after. In the ſixt Generall Council at Conſtance, Act. 1. Conſtantine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe gave for a gift his Holy, as they ſpake, in theſe words: <hi>I give to the Arsh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>biſhop of our auncient Rome.</hi> Which thing alſo the Popes gladly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Boniface to the Emperour Honorius in Diſtinct. 97. of the Church: <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>the City of your gentleneſſe.</hi> Gergorie unto Mauritius ſignifyeth his obedience in proclaming his law, though he approoved not the ſentence of the law. <hi>As for mee, being ſubiect to your cammaundement, J have cauſed your law to be ſent through many parts of the world,</hi> book 2. Epiſt. 61. at the ende. And Agatho ſpeaking of Rome: <hi>This is the ſervile citie of your Maieſty.</hi> in the Council of Conſt. 6. Act. 4. Where then al this time was the <hi>Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Conſtantine.</hi> Although even the very donation, if a good and lawfull should be granted, would bewray ſufficiently in what place then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was. Secondly theſe <hi>Kings</hi> are the <hi>hornes</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> by whoſe means the dignity of the Pope of Rome increaſed, while they drove farre away al the violence of the enemy, which might ſeeme to be able to <hi>detract</hi> anie thing from it. Neither onely gave they it leave to grow by their warres, but alſo inriched it with exceeding wealth. For although the Papiſts bragge impudently of Conſtantines donation, as wee touched even now; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it is certen that they adorned both the citie, and Pope with many privileges, and that they which followed, tooke away nothing; but rather to have added to the heape. Thirdly, they are ſayd <hi>tenne,</hi> becauſe ſo many of the firſt Emperours should be notable for their care, and diligence in ſubduing the enemies of the Romanes. Through which oportunity the <hi>Beaſt lately bread,</hi> might get ſtrength; and might grow up to his perfect ſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture. And theſe were 1. Conſtantine the Great; 2. Conſtantinus, Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and Conſtantius his ſonnes; 3. Iulianus; 4. Iovinianus; 5. Valentinianus, and Valens; 6. Gratianus, Valentianus ſecundus, &amp; Theodoſius the Great; 7. Theodoſius with Arcadius and Honorius; 8. Arcadius and Honorius alone; 9. Honorius and Theodoſius Iunior; 10. Theodoſius &amp; Valentini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us third. For ſo Hierome, Proſper, Victor the Bishop of Tuniſe, Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Comes, and al other writers, both Greek &amp; Latine, whom I hav read, doe recken for <hi>one</hi> the Emperours that reigned togither; for the Romane Empire was but one, though devided in ſtates, &amp; Governours, as alſo the Image in Daniel ch. 2.40. shadowed out one Kingdome by the <hi>leggs</hi> &amp; <hi>feete</hi> divided. As long as theſe reigned, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> riſen up of late flouriſhed; much indeede, and grievouſly afflicted when they were gone; when as ther was no horne for a long ſpace, that was able to keepe away, &amp; remove the enemies from their neckes. Although all the hornes were not certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of an equall ſtrength; but the two laſt were weaker, Rome being twice
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:6819:248"/> taken under Honorius; Alaricus and Arnulphus being Captaines; and nevertheleſſe the Head of the Beaſt not yet deadly wounded, when as the overthrow was more ignominious then dammageable,) Pompon. Laet. on Honorius,) being repaired by and by againe, when the horne began to exerciſe his, and Honorius to be ſtirred up, the Gothes being expelled out of Italy, and Attalus their King triumphed over Rome; and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his right hand cut off, by the commaundement of Honorius caryed in to Lipara, Sabel. En. 8. book 1. Doubtleſſe Conſtantius &amp; Aetius employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their endevour valiantly afterward, &amp; nobly delivered the maieſtie of the Empire from all barbarouſnes; howſoever the chiefe rulers Honorius and Valentinianus were ſlouthfull &amp; cowardous. But after theſe tow laſt hornes were fallen, how many &amp; how great calamities were accumulated daily, when ther was no aide either from the Weſt or Eaſt part, that could repreſſe &amp; thruſt away the malepertnes of the enemies running furiouſly upon him? Therefore by the want of his hornes, he came into that ſtate, <hi>that men thought he had periſhed and was not,</hi> as the ſecond part of his time doth manifeſt, ver. 8. Therefore are they <hi>tenne</hi> for iuſt cauſe; in which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is contained the defending of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which afterward failed for a time, aſſoone as that number was ended. <hi>This is that one houre,</hi> for which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> received power, and not he alone, but thoſe <hi>tenne Hornes</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him; which togither alſo fell downe, when as there was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward no ſtrong or manlie thing in the Weſt for a long time, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt the fiercenes of the enemies. For the reſt that followed, Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Maioranus, Severianus, Anthemius, Rethimer, Olymbrius, Gliceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Nepos, Oreſtes, Auguſtulus, to wit the laſt of the Emperours, were of no leſſe continuance, force &amp; power, then they ar at this day of no fame, ſcarce known either from the ſpeach of men, or by Hiſtories. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the time <hi>of the Kingdome not yet received</hi> was <hi>the time</hi> when Iohn lived, and when this Revelation was made. The Heathen Emperours yet kept the ſtage, to wit the very <hi>Dragon,</hi> while in the meane time the <hi>woman</hi> not yet ſtrong enough, or in time not yet readie to bring foorth her childe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured grievous paine in travelling, as in chapter twelve ver. 2. &amp;c. For howſoever in ſome ages next after Iohn there were ſome men a little more enclined toward Chriſtians, yet the <hi>Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> forthwith devoured al the new hope, lying in wait moſt vigilantly for the woman travailing with childe, until the ful time to bring foorth a valiant iſſue should come. Fiftly, <hi>the time of receiving power</hi> is the ſame houre with the Beaſt. For wee have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the terme alſo of beginning is included in the ſpace of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuing. But ſeeing this is a large houre, in what moment of it was this power give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:6819:249"/> Truely in that, wherin the Lambe caſt downe from the Empire Diocletia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and Maximinian, chap. 6.15. for we shal finde that the Beaſt did appeare at this time, as it is made apparant from the <hi>elect then ſealed</hi> chap. 7. From <hi>the burning mountaine caſt into the Sea</hi> a very little after, chap. 8. From <hi>the Church going into the inner Temple, while the wicked have ſway in the court,</hi> chap. 11. From <hi>the ſpace of fourty two moneths, all which ſhe lay hid in the Temple and wildernes,</hi> chap. 11.3. &amp; 12.6. From the <hi>ſame time of the power given to the Beaſt,</hi> &amp; from <hi>the Throne,</hi> which he received <hi>as a gift from the Dragon</hi> chap. 13.25. But chiefly <hi>from the next ſucceſſion made to the ſixt head,</hi> to weet the <hi>Heathen Emperours,</hi> ver 10. of this chapter. The common terme of all thoſe dependeth from the Dragon his driving out of heaven, when after ſo wonderful a manner, the Emperours reſigned their authority. For what other cauſe is there, why the Church then should be in ſo afflicted ſtate, but for that the Beaſt was riſen up? Therfore the <hi>woman</hi> trembling more for feare of him then of the Dragon, brought forth, and together fled, that is, after she had procreated the Chriſtian Emperours, among whom <hi>Conſtantine</hi> obtaineth the firſt and chiefe place, hating the ambitious and fraudulent Popes introducing shadowes and images of godlines, inſtead of a ſolid and expreſſe paterne more then profeſſed enemies, shee hidde her ſelfe in the darke ſtraight way, chap. 12.6. Therfore theſe alone are <hi>thoſe hornes,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely all theſe properties agree moſt fitly. The Kings that aroſe after the diſsipation of the Empire, began not together with the Beaſt (as we have given him a riſing like as other men every where, in the yeere 606.) but almoſt two hundred yeere before. For the Suevians, Alanes, Goths, Vandals poſſeſſed Spaine when Honorius reigned. The Vandals alſo held Afrike, the Goths, Burgonians, Francons, obtained France; the Engliſh men Britannie, the Hunnes Pannonia; and others cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenged for their owne other countries. Theſe Kings flouriſhed, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the meane ſeaſon being almoſt conſumed with a moſt grievous wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Neither received they power for an houre, as <hi>the true hornes,</hi> but by ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their heires, the which dignity being once gotten, they hold it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly even unto this very day: the glory, I ſay, of the Kingdomes never decayed, howſoever the families peradventure were often changed. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neither ſucceeded they next the ſixt <hi>head:</hi> but they have the Popes and Chriſtian Emperours placed between, and in the midds. By the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments all things fall down, which are brought by Ribera the Ieſuite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning the tenne hornes, Revel. 12. num. 11. as may be evident to him that weigheth the thing on both ſides, that I may not ſpend time in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his toies. If any obiect that ſome of thoſe Emperours were godly, &amp;
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:6819:249"/> holy, let him againe take this anſwer to himſelfe, that the good Princes knew not what monſter they nouriſhed, even as very many learned men, who had no leſſe care to ſet foorth the Beaſt by their writings, then they to defend him by weapons. From whence it is no marvaile, though both ſtrove to their power to adorne him, whoſe counterfait ſhew had a certen maieſtie; but his filthines yet was more hidde, then that it could be ſeen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly. Neither is it needful that al the <hi>hornes</hi> should be togither, more then the <hi>heads,</hi> which ſucceeded one after an other. And the <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelfe <hi>is a rew of Popes,</hi> as wee have shewed, which a long order of ſucceſsion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, not any one perſon limiteth. Yet theſe firſt Emperours are ſo the <hi>hornes,</hi> that togither they containe the whole order following, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before the reſt elected, as it were by name, both becauſe the traveile of theſe should be famous, and the firſt in advancing the Pope, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of the ſame for a time, should be contemned: and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the certen, definit, and excellent number of theſe in the very firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of iniquity, should leade men ſtraight forth to the extolling of the Beaſt in the ages following; and should more aboundantly inſtruct us for to underſtand this whole myſtery. For theſe <hi>hornes</hi> which shall eate the fleſh of the whore, and at length burne her with fire, are farre off from the times of the firſt hornes a thouſand two hundred three ſcore yeeres at the leaſt, as appeareth ſufficiently from thoſe things which have ben ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Neceſſarily therfore is a ſucceſsion to be underſtood, to al which the name of <hi>tenne hornes</hi> agreeth, becauſe the firſt of this number were nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Which things now in this wiſe declared, wee have the third demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, of thoſe that are taken out of this chapter, both of the Antichriſt and alſo his comming. For the Beaſt which received power at one houre with the tenne Kings, who had not yet received a Kingdome in Iohns ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but should receive it ſtraightway when the ſixt head was gone and then preſent, is the Antichriſt. But the Pope of Rome is the Beaſt, which a thouſand three hundred yeeres ſince received power at one houre with thoſe tenne Kings, as wee have made it plaine. Therfore a thouſand three hundred yeeres ſince he is Antichriſt. So al things agree moſt fitly with themſelves, and doo marveilouſly levell at the ſame marke.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>Theſe have one minde:</hi> Such was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>beginning of the Kingdome. The intent</hi> of theſe Kings is, <hi>with one purpoſe of minde to beſtow their ſtrength &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in maintaining the Beaſt.</hi> Which in few wordes, but cleerly inough doo ſhew how the Emperours should be affected towards the Pope of Rome, chiefly for the ſpace of the two &amp; fourty moneths of his flouriſhing tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For the defection should not beginne forthwith at this terme: but
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:6819:250"/> shortly after the former good wil should decay, and abate ſomewhat by little and little of the former heate. But who may not wonder, at ſo great conſent of mindes, through ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a ſucceſsion, that all in like wiſe ſhould deſire, that the chiefe dignity, should be in the poſſeſsion of the Pope of Rome, and should let paſſe nothing, that might pertaine to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and making famous the ſame? The thing is manifeſt to every one in the firſt tenne hornes. Onely Iulianus holpe alſo ſomewhat at leaſt in van<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quishing the enemies of the Empire. Neither in the deſtructions of Rome and when the Popedome was almoſt abolished, was ther want in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of a care to reſerve the former authority <hi>to old Rome,</hi> when it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med meet to tranſlate the Primacie to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the ſeate then of the Empire; eſpecially the Bishops of Conſtantinople chalenging to themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves the ſame with exceeding great contention. Yea at length they reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this ambition of theirs, and commanded them to be ſubiect to the Romane Pope. New <hi>Hornes</hi> at length aroſe in the VVeſt, <hi>Pipine</hi> &amp; <hi>Charles the Great;</hi> they fought farre more fiercely for the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> then any before, in chap. 13.11. Moreover at length it came to this point, that by an othe of fidelity, the Emperours were bound to the Pope, and should now doo neceſſarily, that which before time they did of their owne accord, and vo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>luntarily. It ſeemed to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to ſtand with wiſdome for his greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to uſe this marke afterward, as wee have shewed at chapter 14.17, VVhich cuſtome muſt deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to the poſterity, <hi>until the words of God ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> as after in verſe 17. Some few Emperours indeed had great ſtrife with the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> but in everie one of them this is to be marveiled at, that they though they had to doo onely with <hi>a man,</hi> not with <hi>the Pope.</hi> They hated him peradventure as an enemy: but the Popedome they ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the meane time very ſtudiouſly. But neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had the Pope need of thoſe hornes, who prevailed ſo much by his owne forces, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Emperours ſtruggling with him, to be ſubiect in ſpite of their teeth: and themſelves nowe to undergoe the yoke, by whoſe helpe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought others under the yoke. Or graunt that ſome one, who ſawe more then the reſt, hated alſo the Popedome, <hi>yet one ſwallow maketh not the ſpring.</hi>

               <p n="14">14 <hi>Theſe ſhall fight with the Lambe:</hi> Now he declareth <hi>the warre of theſe
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:6819:250"/> hornes,</hi> which they should make againſt the Lambe. But did Conſtantine &amp; the other good Emper. e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>devour any thing againſt the Lord, for whoſe ſake they take up weapons againſt others? Certenly men <hi>fight againſt the Lambe,</hi> when any thing is defended earneſtly, which is contrary to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. And if any looketh into that manifold ſuperſtition, which was brought in when even the beſt raigned, by the ſame, if not the authours, yet the favourers thereof; he shall eaſily ſee this battell, although the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men thought nothing leſſe, (for ſo I may call them, whom God pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for his Sonnes ſake, and ſinning not of purpoſe, but through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,) then to oppugne the Lambe, whom alone they deſired to beare rule. This, I ſay, may be called a battel againſt the Lambe: yet thoſe firſt Emper. were farr from that warre, which was at length to be made with the Saincts after the <hi>two and fourty moneths were finiſhed.</hi> For ſo wee heard before, <hi>when the two witneſſes have finiſhed their teſtimony, the Beaſt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out of the bottomeleſſe pit, ſhall make warre againſt them, and overcome them,</hi> Chapter 11.7. VVhich wee shewed to have bene done, partly by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope himſelfe, when at Trent he ſubdued the truth by his purpled company: partly by the <hi>weapons of the Emperour Charles the fift,</hi> who togither by a moſt lamentable warre, perſecuted the Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many craving liberty to worship the Lambe; who had begun a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shine againe upon the world after long darkeneſſe. The Angel ſpeaketh in the plurall number, as though all the hornes should make warre togither with ioyned forces. But it is no newe thing that it should be ſaid done of all, which is done of any one of the ſame degree. Many were the entrepriſes before againſt the <hi>Lambe,</hi> but this one deſerveth the name of <hi>warre</hi> above all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the Lambe ſhall overcome them:</hi> See how with this <hi>warre</hi> he ioyneth the victory <hi>of the Lambe;</hi> which may be underſtood of this alone. But the Emperours got the victory in that warre; that is true indeede, if wee reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the very time of darkenes, by the ſpace of which <hi>the two witneſſes muſt lie ſlaine and unburied.</hi> But after thoſe fewe fore appointed dayes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they which of late triumphed as conquerers; now the caſe being alte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, were overcome. Mauritius put to flight the Emperour, and at length compelled him to graunt liberty to true religion, as we ſaid in chapter 11 11.12. This free profeſsion of the trueth is this victory, which the Lambe wrong from the Emperour againſt his will. And not from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but alſo from the reſt which followed; Ferdinandus, Maximilianus, Rodulphus, who ſeeing that they kicked in vaine againſt the pricke, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed noe trouble to the reformed religion.</p>
               <pb n="486" facs="tcp:6819:251"/>
               <p>I would to God at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the Emperour would ſet forth the victory of the Lambe, not onely by reſiſting, but alſo by deteſting the <hi>Romiſh impoſtures.</hi> and by embracing the wholeſome trueth it ſelfe. Why mindeth he not, that he now followeth unwares the <hi>Lambes</hi> charriot? For it happeneth not by chance, but belongeth to a mighty conquerer, to make great ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of a realme favourable to his Church. But whether were it not better, to accompany the triumphant charriot, a fellow and partaker of the victo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, then a priſoner and miſerable ſpectacle of the diſconfiture received? God open his eyes, that in rewarding the whore from his vertues: he firſt of the <hi>hornes</hi> may receive the price of that victory, which if hee shall not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard, nevertheleſſe ſome other shall have it shortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they which are with him, called, and choſen faithfull:</hi> The Chriſtian ſauldiers Mauritius, and the armies of the Proteſtants, by which the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be got the victory. For it pleaſed him not by ſending fire from heaven to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the enemies by his owne power alone, but by the labour of his faithful ſervants. So then we have theſe <hi>hornes</hi> declared <hi>by this warre,</hi> no leſſe notable marke toward their ende, then the number of tenne was at their beginning: ſo the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>ende</hi> being known, here can be noe doubt of the other race that commeth betweene.</p>

So the Prophets are wonte to ſignify a great multitude of people, as <hi>waters doo come up from the North, and become a ſwelling flood,</hi> Ier. chap. 47.2. And of right doo they attribute this name unto them, becauſe of the notable varietie, inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy, and often cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging of their opinions, as of waves toſſed with the wind: whoſe troublous motions are greater, then of any arme or ſtraigth of the ſea, as ſaith the Oratour. <hi>Theſe</hi> therfore are the <hi>waters</hi> of the <hi>whore</hi> ruling farre and neere, what kinde of dominion ſhee had once, while her age &amp; favour was flourishing: in the laſt times, when olde age should disfigure her forehead with wrinkles, they should become farre more shallow, &amp; narrower, as followeth in the next verſe.</p>

As touching the words, in ſtead of <hi>upon the Beaſt,</hi> the Compl. edition, which Montanus and Plantine followeth, doth reade, <hi>and the Beaſt,</hi> as if the <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelfe at length should hate <hi>the whore:</hi> contrary un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Aretas reading, the vulgar Latine, and Theod. Beza from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of very many copies, and in very deed contrary to the manifeſt trueth: for, by the <hi>deſolation</hi> of the whore, which he foresheweth here, the Spirit underſtandeth that calamity that shalbe brought upon <hi>the Kingdome of the Beaſt, by the vial poured out upon his Throne,</hi> chap. 16.10.11. Therefore how can the <hi>Beaſt</hi> shew himſelfe a helper for to abolish and roote out the <hi>whore,</hi> as it followeth from the falſe reading, whoſe fall he shall take ſo grievouſly and immoderately, that <hi>he ſhall gnawe his to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue for exceeding great griefe?</hi> Furthermore, Iohn ſaw the <hi>woman ſitting upon the Beaſt, at what time ſhee commeth forth to condemnation and puniſhment.</hi> When then shalbe this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of company, which they would have, when ſo great a concorde remaineth even to the laſt deſtruction? VVherfore it is a vaine thing, which Bellarmine endevoureth to ſtablish from this place, that Rome is not the ſeate of Antichriſt, becauſe Antichriſt shall hate the whore, which he granteth to be <hi>Rome. For he ſhall not hate,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>his owne ſeate.</hi> But the whole aſſumption is manifeſtly falſe, and leaneth upon no other thing, then a corrupt reading. But why dareth he now depart from the vulgar Latine, which with ſo great praiſes hee extolleth elſewhere, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cill hath decreed to be authenticall alone? The force of the trueth hath compelled him to ſeeke all corners, which if by any meanes he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide, he knew pardon would eaſily be gotten of the Councill. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they which ſhall hate the whore are the tenne hornes,</hi> not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> together with them. For the relative of the neuter antecedent is maſculine, becauſe by theſe <hi>hornes,</hi> men are to be underſtood. But as in the warre againſt the Lambe, that was attributed to the <hi>tenne Kings,</hi> which was done onely by the labour of one, ver. 14. So all are ſaid <hi>to hate the whore,</hi> and at length to torment her with the laſt ſlaughter, which nevertheleſſe is peradve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the commendation <hi>of one</hi> of theſe. For there are not wonte to be many Emperours togither of the ſame dominion. And it may be, that even at the riſing of the Beaſt, the tenne firſt Emperours were famous for good will toward the Pope: ſo contrariwiſe, nigh his ende the tenne laſt ſhalbe for a certaine peculiar hatred to the whore; the laſt whereof shall burne her with fire. But I ſay <hi>the laſt,</hi> not as though they should ceaſe when the Pope ceaſeth, but becauſe they ſhalbe no longer his hornes, whoſe nowe they are counted: from which it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Turke</hi> is not hee, by
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:6819:252"/> whom <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall utterly periſh: but one of the Emperours, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe hornes agree in beginning, progreſſe, and end. Neither indeede would the Turke, if he knew to provide for himſelfe, attempt any thing againſt <hi>Rome:</hi> as long as shee shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſafe, our armies shall doo him no har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Take yee an example o Chriſtians, from that victory at <hi>Kareſta,</hi> a few yeeres ſince, to wit, in the yeere 1596. What was the cauſe that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ye ranne away headlong by a ſudden terrour? Why when the Turks ſled, and left their campe and tents three whole dayes in the fieldes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any keeper, on the other ſide you should runne with violence into a moſt deſperate flight? Some men in time paſt knew not to uſe doubtfull victory; but after the enemies ſlaine and diſconfited and undoubted victo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, for the conquerrers to betake them to their heeles; this exemple, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, may be the firſt, not ſeen, nor heard before. A thing to be greatly wondered at, but the reaſon wherof is not unknowne. This <hi>rodde</hi> is not to be burnt, untill both the Idolatry of the Weſt be forſaken by repentance, and Rome the fountaine &amp; beginning of this impiety, be deſtroyed with the laſt puniſhment. The cruel enemy was ſent into the earth for this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, as wee learned from the ende of the ninth chapter. Neither was any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit of the Hungary expedition to be expected, when the ſtandart of the chiefe Captaine <hi>Archduke Maximilian</hi> was marked on the one ſide with <hi>the Image of bleſſed Mary, with the inſcription of the Patroneſſe of Hungary.</hi> Impiety doubtleſſe drawen <hi>from the cup of the fornication of Rome:</hi> but learne now by experience, how litle it is to your profit, the true Patrone of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth being left, to take unto them other Patrones, with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great iniury to the Saincts. Certenly this Patroneſſe made you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers to runne away. Be ye wiſe at length, and convert your wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Rome, which maketh you a pray by this fraude. This cuppe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and ſhoppe of Idolatry being taken away, there shalbe no need of our armies to punish the cruel Turke: but deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal come to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other place; ſo as he shal cauſe no trouble even after, to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian name. Neither doo I ſpeake theſe things of my ſelfe rashly, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe things which have ben ſaid before in chap. 16.13. &amp; in other pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, partly thoſe things which folow, declare to be moſt certaine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou moſt High Emperial Maieſty, to whom it shalbe peradventure very profitable to be delivered from this enemy; and you the reſt of the Chriſtian Princes, underſtand at length, by what way you may procure, as to your ſelves honour and tranquility, ſo quietneſſe and ioy to the whole Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world. You have failed hitherto in ſetting upon the enemy. Draw your ſwordes againſt Rome; and Conſtantinople shal never procure you
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:6819:252"/> any trouble. Burne ye the whore and bring her to ashes; then shall ye ſee the brethren to come from the Eaſt part, whom the world yet litle or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mindeth, of which the Turke shalbe punished with the laſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſlaughter, for all their abominations and horrible cruelty. <hi>The fift and ſixt vial</hi> of the former chapter, gave ſome taſt of this thing, of which the firſt declareth the <hi>deſolation of Rome,</hi> the ſecond, that the <hi>caling of the Iewes,</hi> shal come by and by after. Which, what it availeth to that thing which I ſpeake of, shall appeare in his places more cleerly. At length, weigh dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the things that are written. I would not dare, being unknowne, and even at home of no fame, ſpeake unto moſt famous Princes, the lights of the countries, concerning a matter of ſo great moment, unleſſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the divine trueth had encouraged mee.

               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:6819:253"/>
               <p>In ſuch wiſe, as Conſtantine the Great gave to bleſſed <hi>Silveſtre</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours his Palace, the Citie of Rome, and all the Provinces, places and Cities of Italy, or of the Countries in the weſt part. But graunt that <hi>Pipin</hi> &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> gave them through ignorance; for the weale, as they thought, of Chriſtian piety: but after that it hath bene knowne by experience, that nothing hath redounded more to the deſtruction therof, why may they not take their owne againe, and get fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>whore</hi> the wages of her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? But the Princes have no need to be taught what is their right, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely they would open their eyes, that they might acknowledge the <hi>whore</hi> ſuch as shee is in very truth. And who ſeeth not that theſe things were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun ever ſince the time of Charles the V. whom I ſuppoſe to be the firſt of theſe <hi>tenne laſt hornes;</hi> eſpecially from that moment, in which he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Lambe by the armes of <hi>the Proteſtants?</hi> Of him God would have that Rome, though a fewe yeeres before, should be taken, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rably ſacked, by the Prince of Borbon, as it were for an example, &amp; pledg of thoſe things, which at length shee should ſuffer at the hands of one of the tenne hornes, of which he leadeth the ranke. <hi>Ferdinandus, Maximilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Rodulphus,</hi> who at this day enioy the Empire; if they have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more grievous againſt Rome, they left her certenly forſaken &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Tooke they up weapons for her ſake? Suffered they not frely their ſubiects, the Romish ſuperſtition being reiected, to profeſſe true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But now they shall ſucceede next, who ſhall <hi>eate her fleſh,</hi> that is, who ſhall not onely ſuffer her to lie naked and forſaken utterly, but alſo ſhall deale with her by violence, and ſhall no longer provide for her profits in their dominions, but shall hold it ſufficient for ſubiects to pay tributes to their lawfull Princes; yea peradventure shal enter an action againſt her, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againe the things, that I made mention of even now. And at length shall one riſe up, who shal <hi>conſume her with fire,</hi> as which cannot be purged with any other nitre; which day commeth with ſpeed, as may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from the things before ſpoken: but wee shal heare of a nigher term from the things following.</p>

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:6819:253"/> to give their Kingdome to the Beaſt, until the words of God be fulfilled;</hi> as though he should ſay, as ye know for a ſurety that overpaſſed conſent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours unto humble ſervice, ſo certen is this future alienation of their mindes, and at length that final deſtroying, which I ſpake of: There is one and the ſame authour of both. Neither let us take it grievouſly, if the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement ſeeme to ſtay long; the divine wiſdome hath ſet a time, which to accuſe of too much ſlackenes, would be a token of overhaſtie deſire, and importunate wish: for until, ſaith he, <hi>the words of God be fulfilled,</hi> that is un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>til the decree shalbe ended and accomplished, which by his word he hath foreshewed to be hereafter. VVherby is ſignifyed the time of <hi>the fift vial,</hi> at the powring out wherof, shalbe fulfilled all thoſe things touching the <hi>whore:</hi> which wilbe shortly, ſeing our times have reached unto <hi>the fourth,</hi> as wee have shewed in the former chapter.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>And the woman which thou ſaweſt:</hi> So was the interpretation of the <hi>Dominion;</hi> now of the <hi>Palace:</hi> which, all circumſtances omitted, declareth moſt playnely that this <hi>woman is the great City, which raigneth over the Kings of the earth.</hi> Therfore this <hi>Citie</hi> is not the whole ſtate of the wicked, whoſe dominion is no more famous over the Kings, then over the multitude of people: but <hi>a City in deed</hi> wel knowen for her rule over the higheſt among mortal men: and ſo much the more becauſe theſe words are in ſtead of an interpretation; neither is the Spirit wont to give an expoſition darker the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the things that are to be expounded. Therfore it is a city properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>great</hi> indeede, and the <hi>Lady</hi> of other Princes; there can be no other ſuch <hi>Head City</hi> in the Chriſtian world then <hi>Rome, an abridgement of the whole world;</hi> the Queene of the nations, Lady of Kings, and once in warres, now in ſuperſtition the chiefe: to whom, even in this decrepite age, her former large poſſeſsions being greatly minished, the Emperours, Spanish, Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch. and Polonian Kings yet ſubmit themſelves, beſides other Princes of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour degree.

And wee have shewed, that the <hi>Bp. of Rome,</hi> from the time of the Hethen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, hath long ſince undergone the three firſt of theſe fowr notable cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, giving moſt ſure documents of the fourth alſo. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Antichriſt is the <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th</hi> head of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which next ſucceeded the hethen Emperours, who made the <hi>ſixt,</hi> which then was when Ihon wrote; Rev. 17.10.11. Therfore ſo ſoon as they ceaſed, came forth he that had the dignity of the next head. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the then hornes, which are ten abſolute Kings, had their ſoveraingntie after that the <hi>ſixt head</hi> was fallen; that is, after that the Hethen Emperours were expelled. For from the time that the Beaſt bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt to reign; they never wanted crownes, chap. 18.7. And <hi>crownes</hi> have place no where ells, but on the heads and hornes: therfore of neceſsitie ſo ſoon as they be taken away from them, they are tranſferred unto theſe. But ſeing the <hi>ſeventh head,</hi> that is Antichriſt, receiveth power at the ſame howr, with the ten horns: it foloweth that then began he to exiſt, when the Roman Hethen tyrants ceaſed. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the woman fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, when the Dragon was caſt out of heaven, that is, when the Hethe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperours were depoſed; as is largely declared in the 7.11. and 12. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And whom should she more fear and flee, than Antichriſt? Therfore she getting her ſelfe into the wildernes, at his riſing up: it plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Antichriſt came at the ſame abdication of the Emperours. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> ſince the Hethen Emperours have been doon away, Rome hath moſt va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the defenſe &amp; patronage of the Pope. And at that time should this City be both the <hi>whore,</hi> dnd <hi>ſeat of Antichriſt,</hi> when she should be caried of the Beaſt, and shine cheifly with his dignity. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> the conſent of the whole Propheſie confirmeth it; which according to this account, very wel agreeth with it ſelfe, both in the whole, and in al the parts therof: wheras otherwiſe, as it were with members rent and torn aſunder, it yeildeth a pourtrature of inexplicable confuſion. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> even the Papiſts themſelves unwares doo acknowledge, that Antichriſt hath drawn his original, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this very beginnin. For whiles they boaſt of <hi>Conſtantines donation,</hi> and the whole Weſt to be ſubiect to the <hi>Biſhop of Rome:</hi> they shew ſufficiently, by their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion, about what time this <hi>Adverſarie</hi> of Chriſt came forth.

But al theſe things, we hav more largely handled and unfolden, in opening the words of the Apoſtle: now we would but gather them into a breif ſumm, that the things which were ſpoken diſperſedly, being ſet under one view, might shew more clearly, how by the Apoſtles few words, al Popiſh and Ieſuitiſh ſubtilties, as toucht with lightning from heaven, doo fly on fyre, and come to nothing. Theſe therfore be the common arguments, and to be applyed unto al the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the diſputation folowing: which we thought good to warn thee <hi>Reader</hi> of, that thou mayſt ſet them rather from hence, unto every queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than that we should often repeat them.

Now therfore let us enconter with Bellarmine hand to hand, and not baulk any of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds: that he may the better ſee how in vayn he hath tried his ſtrength againſt the truth.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>firſt cheife point</hi> is, of this common name of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> which he en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forceth to ſignify one <hi>contrary to Chriſt; and not contrarie in what ſort ſoever, but ſo, as that he ſtriveth with him for ſeat and dignitie; that is, one which is Chriſts envious adverſarie, and would be accounted the Chriſt, when he which is indeed the Chriſt, is caſt down.</hi> The firſt part of which interpretation I eaſily grant, that <hi>Antichriſt is one contrary to Chriſt:</hi> but wheras not content with this, he requireth ſuch a contrariety as was between <hi>Marius</hi> &amp; <hi>Sylla, Pompey</hi> &amp; <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that openly warred one with an other; the Spirit convinceth that of falſhood, teaching that the <hi>Beaſt hath two horns like the Lamb,</hi> Revel. 13.11. that he is a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and that <hi>it is a point of ſingular wiſdome, to knowe and perceive the Beaſt; Here is the mind,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that hath wiſdome:</hi> Revel. 17.9. Can any man be ſo blockiſh, that if ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warre be waged againſt Chriſt, he should not know his enemie? Need any man be deceived, wher the matter is carried by profeſſed force? The great Antichriſt shal deceive more than he shal compel: he shal come <hi>with al deceaveablenes of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes among them that periſh,</hi> ſaith th'Apoſtle, 2 Theſ. 2.10. wherto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypſe agreeth, <hi>and he ſhal ſeduce the inhabitans of the earth,</hi> chap. 13.14. Shal this ſeducer have his deceits and ſleights in open view? Nothing is more contrary to his diſpoſition. Be it therfore that ther is ſome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which wil openly vaunt himſelfe to be <hi>Chriſt:</hi> yet is not this the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perty of the <hi>Great Antichriſt.</hi> But think not therfore that any goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:6819:255"/> him in wickednes. The Divil hurteth more under the shape of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light: then under the horrible hiew of a Dragon.</p>
                        <p>But you goe about to prove the thing, three manner of wayes. <hi>Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe the name Antichriſt, cannot by any meanes ſignify Chriſts Vicar. For</hi> Anti <hi>in compoſition, never ſignifyeth ſubordination, as is manifeſt by the exemples of all ſuch names. But a Vicar ſignifyeth not oppoſition but ſubordination: and the Pope is Chriſts Vicar; and therfore not Antichriſt.</hi> I anſwer; Though I should grant you that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> cannot ſignify <hi>Chriſts Vicar:</hi> yet were the Pope no whit the further from being Antichriſt. For the argument is framed of an aequivocation; and therfore concludeth nothing. In the firſt propoſition, you put a true and proper <hi>Vicar,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in deede cannot be; who is a malicious, although a ſecret enemy; that it is a true name wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Scriptures doo deſcribe him, of <hi>Adverſary, Man of ſin, Angel of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> &amp; <hi>Beaſt.</hi> In the ſecond, you aſſume a <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar,</hi> not naturall &amp; lawful, but one that is ſuch by wicked ambition, ſacrilegious uſurpation, and falſe boaſting. From which no other thing can be concluded than this, that the Pope is not Antichriſt by his own confeſsion; which I eaſily graunt you. For we reaſon not, I trow, by what name Antichriſt shal call himſelfe: but, what name he is worthy of, and what the Scriptures give unto him. It is not to be exſpected, that he will bewray himſelfe, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe that he is the <hi>man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, the Angel of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe pit, the Beaſt,</hi> and the like: which if he should doo, verily he should not play the <hi>falſe Prophet.</hi> Fayrly therfore have you freed your Pope, in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing that he is not Antichriſt by his owne teſtimony. Secondly I anſwer, that it is falſe which you affirm of the ſignification of this word <hi>Anti,</hi> (though now it be little to the purpoſe what force it hath;) which I will make playn alſo by examples. <hi>Antimiſt hotos,</hi> is one that is hyred in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans ſted; <hi>Antibaſileus,</hi> is a <hi>Vice-roy,</hi> or one in the Kings ſtead: <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrategos,</hi> is the Lievtenant, or he that is in ſtead of a Captayn; as H. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen sheweth in Theſ. Graec. even the ſame that <hi>Hypoſtrategos</hi> is with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio in Anabaic: and the ſame that <hi>Propraetor,</hi> as Budaeus teacheth, from Demoſthenes. <hi>Antuputhos</hi> is the Deputie or Proconſul. In al which <hi>Anti</hi> ſignifyeth ſubordination. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Hypoſtrategos, is an equal Captaine, even as with the Latines Propraetor and Proconſul ſignifyeth not the vicar of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor or Conſul, but he that is the ſame in a Province, which a Praetor or Conſul is in a City: and that herein Muſculus was deceived, who becauſe he read that Antiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegos ſignifyed a Propraetor, thought that it ſignifyed a Vicar of the Praetor, which is falſe.</hi> I anſwer; the firſt <hi>Proconſuls</hi> had but a deputed Magiſtracie in ſted of others, as witneſſeth L. Feneſtella de Magiſtr. Rom. lib. 2. cap. 11. <hi>All
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:6819:256"/> which time,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Proconſul exerciſed not an ordinary but a delegated juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: though after through cuſtome it came to paſſe, that this Magiſtrate got a proper juriſdiction.</hi> And this is that which Dionyſ. Halicarnaſ. ſayth in Ant. Rom. lib. 11. that <hi>the firſt Proconſuls were created in the third yere of the 84. Olympiad:</hi> though he had before made mention of <hi>T. Quintius created Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſul in the ſecond yere of the 79. Olympiad;</hi> that is, 21. yeres before; lib. 9. To weet, becauſe theſe Proconſuls, as T. Quintius and the like, exerciſing but a power of thruſt; were not to be reckned among the ordinary Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but thoſe that after the limits of their governance proroged, had proper authority. And then of right caried they the dignitie granted, &amp; the name of Magiſtrate. Yet thoſe Proconſuls of-truſt, were called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thupatoi,</hi> as appeareth by Dionyſius ſpeaking of this T. Quintius. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Muſculus was not deceived in this as you ſay: but your ſelfe are egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly beguiled, who through affection of oppugning the trueth, ſee not the thing that is moſt certen.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, you prove it by ſcriptures, from which you rightly judge the ſignification of this name is to be cheifly fetched. And firſt you alledge, that <hi>he is caled Antichriſt. which is exalted above all that is caled God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. <hi>which certes,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is not to be the Vicar, but the enemy of Cgriſt, the true God.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt ſeing here is the ſame aequivocation in the word <hi>Vicar,</hi> which was before: this argument hath like force with the former, that is, none at al. Secondly I ſay, that to be <hi>exalted above all that is caled God,</hi> is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively ſpoken, not properly. For the true God, is never caled <hi>al God,</hi> but <hi>one,</hi> as th'Apoſtle ſayth, 1 Cor. 8.5.6. <hi>For though ther be which ar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods both in heaven and in earth, (as there are Gods many, and Lords many,) yet to us ther is but one God even the Father, and one Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The other Gods which are many, are often caled, <hi>all;</hi> as Pſal. 97.7. <hi>worſhip him all ye Gods.</hi> Therfore to be <hi>exalted above every God,</hi> is not above the one God in heaven, but above every God on earth, that is, above the civil <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> to whom the Scriptures doo attribute the name of <hi>God.</hi> VVhich alſo is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the word which foloweth <hi>(Sebaſma) worſhip.</hi> For if God be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> properly, how is that ſet after, which is leſſe? In diſtributions, that which is leſſe, is wont to be ſet before; ſo that one can not rightly ſay, <hi>who is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above every King or every ſubiect;</hi> but contrary, he that is exalted <hi>above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſubiect, or Ring.</hi> But taking <hi>God</hi> figuratively, the ſpeech encreaſeth ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, thus; who is exalted above al Magiſtrates, and not onely the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſort, but alſo above every worshipful Maieſtie among men, even the higheſt Caeſars; which are caled <hi>Sebaſtoi</hi> &amp; <hi>Sebaſmoi,</hi> 1. venerable. Finally, as touching the <hi>true God,</hi> how should Antichriſt, acknowledging no God
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:6819:256"/> but himſelfe, ſit in the Temple of that God? as the Apoſtle teacheth, 2 Theſ. 2.4. Doubtleſſe he would aboliſh the Temples of all thoſe, whoſe names, and much leſſe their worship and honour, he cannot abide. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should he be ſubtile, if he boaſted himſelfe ſuperiour unto God in heaven; but in al mens iudgement, moſt doting and fanatical. Wherfore by theſe words, Antichriſt should exerciſe his pride againſt the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, whom he would tread under his feet, as by too many lamentable examples your Pope of Rome hath doon. But this ſupreme eminency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove al earthly powers, makes no neceſsity of open warr againſt Chriſt, but may very wel conſiſt togither with the feigned humility of his Vicar.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond place is from 1 Iohn. 2.22. <hi>that he is caled Antichriſt, which denieth Jeſus to be the Chriſt; that is,</hi> ſay you, <hi>which denieth Jeſus to be the Chriſt, that he may vaunt himſelfe to be the Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer; this interpretation is Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, that is, quite from the purpoſe of the holy Apoſtle. You wil have this denyal to be open, manifeſt, impudent: the Apoſtle ſeemeth to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy no ſuch matter, but rather al things contrary. For it was of men which newly and privily had crept in, of whom the faithfull ſcarſely ſuſpected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing; but had need to be warned, that <hi>many Antichriſts were come already,</hi> ver. 18. It was of them which <hi>went out from us, but were not of us;</hi> ver. 19. that is, which bare the name of Chriſtians, as did Ebion, Cerinthus, and others of that leven, who reteyning Chriſts name, could not openly deny him, but onely privily and trecherouſly. Finally, it was of ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt, as should deny alike the <hi>Father and the Son,</hi> as ver. 22. But he would not openly deny the Father, for ſo he should manifeſt himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al, to be altogither Godleſſe, contrary to that which the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that he should <hi>ſit in the Temple of God.</hi> Therfore, when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of a privie denyal, and you would wreſt it unto that which is put before al mens eyes: you shal get nothing from this place, but a proof un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to us of your egregious skil, to conclude from any thing, whatſoever you lyſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>third</hi> place is from Mat. 24.5. <hi>For many ſhal come in my name, ſaying, J am Chriſt:</hi> and againe verſ. 24. <hi>For ther ſhal ariſe falſe Chriſts:</hi> from which you gather that <hi>he ſhal affirme himſelfe to be Chriſt, which ſurely,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is not the part of a Vicar, but of an adverſary.</hi> I anſwer; this <hi>Vicar</hi> is very fertile unto fraud, that corrupteth ſo many arguments with the ambiguity thereof. For here it dallyeth as it did before, with the divers acception of the word. But beſides that, why doo you not obſerv, that <hi>many ſhal come in Chriſts name?</hi> and that <hi>falſe Chriſts ſhal ariſe?</hi> Our Lord treateth not of one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man: but sheweth that many shal arrogate to themſelves his name of
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:6819:257"/> 
                           <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If theſe things therfore be ſpoken of the very Antichriſt, then ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he shalbe no one ſingular man. So this place, in ſted of gayn which you hoped for, turneth to your dammage. Our Lord chiefly noteth out the Antichriſts of the Iewes: whoſe impudency, though it should be greater, yet the hurt by them should be leſſer, then that which should redounde from the great An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ichriſt. But we shal hav occaſion hereafter to interpret this place: in the meane while, theſe Scriptures doo help your cauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>third</hi> argument, is <hi>from al authors which have written of Antichriſt; &amp; from the conſent of al Chriſtians:</hi> And in ſted of them al, you mention of the ancients Damaſcen, and Hierom; and Henry Stephen of our writers. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to you agayn, of the ancient Fathers, this one S. Ephrem, (whom Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom celebrateth with the praiſes of an high witt) that hence forth you boaſt no more ſo laviſhly of <hi>al authors.</hi> Thus ſpeaketh he in his ſermon of Antichriſt: <hi>Jn this habit ſhall the foul theif come. For that the deceiver and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpeaker, may deceive al men; he wil feighn himſefe humble, courteous, deſpiſing unrighteouſnes, ſhuning Idols, making a ſhew of piety, benigne, poor, ſtudious, fayr beyond al admiration, gentle, cheerful unto al men.</hi> Theſe things ſaith he. Where now is that open warr, with this notable Iugler? where is that manifeſt pride, wherby this deep diſſembler of humility, should lift up himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every God? where is that manifeſt tyranny, with this <hi>iuſt, pious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningn, poor, and courteous</hi> fellow in shew towards al men? If I would ſerch the iudgements of the reſt; I doubt not but you should wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t much of your ſumme of <hi>al authors.</hi> As for H. Stephen, he acknowledgeth the word to have this force, that he iudgeth them alſo to be reckned by the name of <hi>Antichriſts, which thou they profeſſe the name of Chriſtians, yet are in deed the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Chriſt, whiles they adulterate his doctrine with many forgeries. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they boaſt of Chriſt with their mouth, yet in hart they deſire his overthrow: and eſpecially they which with wicked boldnes doo invade his royal ſeat: and likewiſe they which derogate from his godhead.</hi> Theſe be his words; none of which, but doo very well fit the Bp. of Rome. From al which thus diſputed, you now gather up your firſt argument againſt us adverſaries: and leaſt the whole should not agree with the parts, you conclude with the ſame fine equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that you trimmed al the former with, after this manner: <hi>The name of Antichriſt ſignifyeth an enemy and rival of Chriſt: But the Pope of Rome profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelfe Chriſts ſervant, and ſubiect to Chriſt in al things: Therfore he is not Antichriſt:</hi> to weet, <hi>by his owne confeſſion:</hi> which who ſo yeildeth not, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> For ſo you might more rightly have eſtablished this moſt ſure concluſion, than the Fathers of Trent, doo their canons. But
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:6819:257"/> know, I pray you, Bellarmine, that continual equivocating, is intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trifling.</p>

                        <head>Chap. 2. That Antichrist shal not be any one certayn man.</head>
                        <p>THE ſecond chapter maketh <hi>Quaere,</hi> whither <hi>Antichriſt properly ſo caled, be one certayn man: or a ſingular throne, and tyrannical Kingdome.</hi> The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> al doo think, he shalbe one certayn man. But thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which we ſet down in the beginning of this diſputation, doo evince the contrary. For if Antichriſt have reigned from about the 300 yere of our Lord, unto this day, as is ſufficiently shewed; then is he no one ſingular perſon. Moreover, if any wil but mind thoſe ſtreights of time, the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this dominion, the multitude of things that are to be done, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the greatnes, which the Papiſts doo in their fiction apply to An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt: he wil wonder that men can ſo dote, as to thinke that all theſe things are to be found in one perſon. But beſides, a part of his reigne is <hi>a thouſand yeres,</hi> as shal after be shewed, chap. 20.4.5. Let us ſee therfore, with what reaſons you confirme your opinion.</p>
                        <p>You alledge for this purpoſe, Scriptures and Fathers. The Scriptures are five; the firſt out of the Goſpel of Iohn, 5.43. <hi>J am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if an other come in his owne name, him ye wil receive. Theſe words,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are to be underſtood of the true Antichriſt, and that both by the teſtimony of certain Fathers, and by the propriety of the words themſelves.</hi> I anſwer; as touching the Fathers, I like not to diſcuſſe their opinions. It would be long, and not much to the purpoſe: for al men doo confeſſe, which are not wilfully blind, that in this matter of Antichriſt, they erred much, through darknes of the times. Let us inſiſt upon the ſure way of finding out the trueth by the Scriptures, which neither can deceive, nor be deceived. What therfore is that force of the words, which requireth to have him one <hi>ſingular perſon?</hi> This you endevour to shew fowr wayes. <hi>Firſt, becauſe our Lord oppoſeth to himſelfe, an other man; that is, perſon to perſon; as appeareth by his words, J, an other; in my name, in his owne name; me, him. As therfore Chriſt was one ſingular man: ſo ſhal Antichriſt bee.</hi> I anſwer; the force of this Argument lyeth in three oppoſite words, <hi>an other, in his owne name, him:</hi> of which the two laſt depend on the firſt: for what reſpect this hath, the ſame the other wil have, ſeing al are referreth to the ſame thing. But <hi>an other,</hi> denoteth not one ſingular perſon, as Grammarians teach, which

So, <hi>to one is given the word of knowledge, to an other faith, to an other the gift of healing, to an other power to doo great works, to an other Propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 12.8.9.10. You wil not ſay, I trow, that theſe gifts were proper to ſingular men, but common to many. In like ſort Paul ſayth, <hi>Jf anie other ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth to have wherof he may truſt in the fleſh, much more J.</hi> Phil. 3.4. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth not himſelfe with a ſingular man, but with any one of many. You provide very evil for your cauſe, to fetch confirmation from thence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is moſt overthrown.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you ſay, <hi>Chriſt here ſaith, that Antichriſt ſhalbe received of the Iewes: and it is evident, that the Iewes doo exſpect one certayn and ſingular man.</hi> I anſwer, ther is nothing at al ſound in this reaſon. For neyther is this great Antichriſt, whom the Apocalypſe ſpeaketh of, and of whom we intreat; he whom the Iewes shal receive; as is playn by the things ſpoken before, and shalbe mor largely declared hereafter: neither is the Antichriſt of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es, one certayn and ſingular man: for <hi>manie ſhal come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>in my name, ſaying I am Chriſt:</hi> where he ſpeaketh chiefly of them that ſhould riſe among the Iewes, Mat. 24.5. Alſo their own Hiſtory ſheweth, that more than one, have been counted for the Chriſt, which have ſacrilegiouſly cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lenged the name of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to themſelves. And as touching their exſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctation, this dooth no more prove one ſingular perſon, then the Papiſts exſpectation proveth him to be one certayn man. We doo exſpect, that you ſhould bring forth ſome thing more firm, than your fooliſh exſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly you ſay, that <hi>Al falſe Prophets have come in the name of an other, not in their own name; Therfore Antichriſt, which ſhal come by a ſpecial manner in his owne name, is one ſingular perſon.</hi> I anſwer, Antichriſt shal come in no other manner, as touching his name, than al the other falſe Prophets. For <hi>name</hi> is not an appellation or title, but authority; as is manifeſt by the oppoſite branch therof, to weet, <hi>the name of the Father: J am come,</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>in my Fathers name,</hi> that is, not with the Fathers appellation, as if I were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but by the miſsion and authority of the Father. So, to come <hi>in his
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:6819:258"/> owne name,</hi> is not to boaſt of the proper title of his name, but to come in his own authority, no lawful power being given him of God. And thus doo al the falſe Prophets come both in the name of an other, &amp; in their owne name. In the name of an other feighnedly and counterfeitly; in that they falſely boaſt of a ſending: but in their owne name, in very deed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have none but their owne authority, and <hi>run when they are not bidden,</hi> as ſayth the Prophet. Wherfore there wil be no difference in this thing, between Antichriſt; and the other falſe Prophets his companions.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly you ſay, <hi>Our Lord would not have ſayd, If an other come; but many come; if he would have ſpoken of falſe Prophets.</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt by this word <hi>an other,</hi> ſignifyeth that many shal come: for it is a nown partitive of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as we have shewed. Neither could that ſwarm of <hi>Falſe-Chriſts,</hi> which he mentioneth in Mathew, be intimated more breifly and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly, than in this maner. But as you, by your ſuppoſed ſilence, (which yet perhaps you now perceive is lowder uttered than you would,) doo en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>devour to eſtabliſh one ſingular perſon: ſo give me leave, I pray you, by Chriſts true ſilence, to overthrow moſt certainly, the ſame ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For doo you think, that Chriſt in Mat. 24. inſtructing his Diſciples ſo diligently of future evils, even until his coming, and ſpecially of Falſe Prophets, from whom much danger should ariſe: would not ſo much as one word make mention of this one ſingular man, ſo cruel a plague, of whom it behooved them moſt of al to beware? It is certayn therfore that this whole dream of one ſingular Antichriſt was an errour in the ancient writers, and is madnes in you, that wil perſevere in the errour.</p>

                           <hi>the deceiver &amp; the Antichriſt,</hi> 2 Iohn. 7. where yet he ſpeaks not of that chief Antichriſt which was to come, but of ſome ſuch like ſorte. By which it ſufficiently appeareth, that Antichriſt with an article, is not a ſingular perſon.</p>
                        <p>The fourth place is Daniel 7. and 11. and 12. Out of the 7. chapter, you take thoſe things which are ſpoken of the <hi>little horn,</hi> ver. 8. &amp;c. <hi>which,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are to be expounded of Antichriſt, and that for two reaſons. Firſt from the authoritie of certain Fathers: then from the words of Daniel himſelfe.</hi> I anſwer; as touching the authority of the Fathers, I know many learned men doo interprete theſe words of Antichriſt: but this Apocalypſe diſpelleth the darknes, which taking away the ſight before, ſuffred not to behold the thing it ſelfe. For it teacheth that that <hi>little horne,</hi> differeth much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>Antichriſt</hi> whom Iohn deſcribeth. For Antichriſt is one of the <hi>heads</hi> of the Beaſt, which is of many formes, both in Daniel and in Iohn: but a <hi>little horn,</hi> is onely ſome addition ioyned to the head. Moreover, this ariſeth af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the ten hornes: but Antichriſt riſeth togither and at one houre with al his. That, ſubdueth three horns under it; the other unſubdued, are eyther foes of the ſame, or at leaſt freinds of equal power: but <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is over al the 10. horns, which willingly ſerv him, until the appointed time. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that is caled <hi>little:</hi> Antichriſt is not litle, who hath power over every tribe, tongue, and nation: Apoc. 13.7. who alſo beareth the whore, to whom peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues doo obey, and which reigneth over the Kings of the earth, Apoc. 17.15.18. But, you wil ſay, it may be it is caled <hi>litle</hi> in the beginning, not in the full age. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the chiefeſt heighth of dignity, when he ſhal moſt flouriſh, ſhal lift it ſelf no higher, then over the 3. horns, which he shal depreſſe. Doubtles the Spirit would have made mention of moe, if he had had power over
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:6819:260"/> moe. That <hi>horn</hi> therfore is not this <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> but if we wil rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thing, it is that Dragon of the ſixt vial of this Apocalypſe, chap. 16.13. namely the <hi>Turk;</hi> for of him and the other enemies that should oppreſſ the Iewes, doth Daniel onely ſpeak, without any mention of the Weſtern Antichriſt; as it may be, occaſion wilbe given elſwhere, to decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re more fully. This diſparitie therfore, wil by no means ſuffer theſe two to convene in one. Wherupon you may now ſee, that we ar not ſo much to look, either who or how many they be that ſay a thing: as with what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they ſo perſwade themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you ſay from the words of Daniel, chap. 7.24. <hi>that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, (whom ancient writers wil have to be meant by the little horn;) is a ſingular perſon: for he is not caled one Kingdome, but one King: who of ten Kings that he ſhould find in the world, ſhould take three quite away, and ſubdue the other ſeven un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, theſe laſt words <hi>and ſhal ſubdue the other ſeven under him,</hi> is a very bold comment, ſeing no footſtep of them appeareth in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. For he onely ſayth, ver. 8. <hi>ſo that three of thoſe former horns were rooted out from before him:</hi> and againe ver. 24. <hi>and three Kings ſhal he depreſſe:</hi> but of the ſubduing of the other 7. he no where maketh mention. And how, I pray you, should he be a <hi>little horn,</hi> if he should deſtroy three, and have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over al the reſt? Theſe things are unadviſedly brought in by ſome old writers, but worſe reteyned by you, for to darken the truth. But this is little to the purpoſe, for the force of the argument. Therfore, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſay, that it is falſe to affirme, <hi>becauſe he is caled one King, he is one perſon:</hi> for the Angel before ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Theſe great Beaſts which are fowr, are fowr Kings, that ſhal riſe out of the earth:</hi> ver. 17. which yet are not fowr ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſons, but ſo many Kingdomes: as your ſelf can not deny.</p>
                        <p>The other place of Daniel is from chap. 11, ver. 21.— 36. <hi>where literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is treated of Antiochus Epiphanes: but allegorically (as Calvin, and Ciprian, and Jerom</hi> you ſay, <hi>doo interpret it,) of Antichriſt, whoſe figure Antiochus did bear. Therfore ſeing he was one certayn and ſingular perſon; Antichriſt alſo muſt be one certayn perſon.</hi> I anſwer; great in deede is the agreement of the wicked, and needs muſt many things in them be found alike, who are governed by one and the ſame Spirit; for which cauſe, thoſe learned men avouched him to be the type of Antichriſt, after a common ſort: but that the Spirit inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for the type properly, as he is wont in the other ſcriptures, I ſee not how it can be rightly ſaid It hath not ſuch agreement with that which they make the truth therof, as is wont to be found in other types. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: this <hi>Antiochus</hi> is the litle horn of the <hi>Goat,</hi> of whom it is ſaid ch. 8.14. that he should rage <hi>two thouſand and three hundred dayes.</hi> Shal this
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:6819:260"/> be the type of Antichriſt? Then shal he not reign onely three yeres and a halfe, but ſix yeres and more then an halfe; and ſo an other Antichriſt is to be looked for, then yee yet feighn. Or if you wil have it, that al things are not ſo exactly anſwerable in the type and antitype: yet in a wiſe maſter-builder, this, I trow, muſt needs be required, that he make not the portch bigger then the houſe; that is, that the type reign not longer then the truth. I remember, that 390. dayes were given to Ezechiel for a ſigne of ſo many yeeres: but no where ſo many yeres to be given unto any for a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne of ſo many dayes. Secondly I anſwer, let Antiochus be the type, yet can not one perſon be from thence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded: ſeing one ſingular type may as wel note out many perſons, as many perſons one; as we ſee in that row of Levitical Preiſts, who al had relation unto one Chriſt, as unto their pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed end.</p>
                        <p>The third place of Daniel, is from chap. 12.11.12. wher the Angel ſaith, <hi>From the time that the dayly ſacrifice ſhalbe taken away, and the deſolating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet up, ther ſhalbe a thouſand two hundred ninetie dayes. Bleſſed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thouſand three hundred five and thirty dayes.</hi> Of this place you add nothing, but reſt in ſome mens interpretation, which have applied it unto Antichriſt. Theſe dayes you would have to be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and therfore that he is one ſingular perſon, whoſe reign is defined in ſo ſhort a time. I anſwer, this number perteyneth nothing at al unto An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſts reign for three yeres and an halfe, before the ſecond coming of our Lord. For Daniel asketh, when the end shalbe of theſe marvelous things? wil you have the anſwer to be this: After the end of 1290. dayes, or at moſt, of 1335. before the laſt end of al things? what would ſuch an anſwer teach? If one that is in a farr cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try should ask which way he muſt goe to Rome; and an other should anſwer, when you come at the tenth ſtone from the city, you muſt turn this way or that, to the left hand or to the right: might not he wel think himſelf to be mocked? Or, if one ſhould ask of any climate, how long the day is in that country; and anſwer ſhould be made; about half an howr after ſun ſetting: would he think himſelf ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied? Even ſuch an anſwer doo yee attribute to the Angel, whiles ye iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge theſe to be common dayes, and to goe immediatly before the end of al things. Farr be it from us to think the holy Angel would ſo jeſtingly cloſe up this divine viſion, and ſpecially the whole Propheſie. In none of theſe places therfore doo we find Antichriſt ſo properly caled, much leſſe his ſingular perſon.</p>
                        <p>So much of the fourth Scripture. The fift and laſt is Apoc. 13. &amp; 17. <hi>Which places,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are meant of Antichriſt, for ſo teacheth Jreneus lib. 5. and

As Daniel therfore ſpeaketh of one certayn King: ſo dooth John in the Apocalypſe.</hi> I anſwer, Ireneus iudgeth rightly, that the Apocalypſe in the ſayd places dooth treat of Antichriſt: but you ar wrong, that would have ſuch an Antichriſt to be meant, as is in Daniel. I have shewed that theſe two doo differ many wayes, ſo as the one cannot be the other. Thoſe <hi>ten hornes</hi> in Daniel, are not this <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Anſwerable in deede they are to the <hi>Dragons hornes;</hi> but the <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath not horns common with the <hi>Dragon.</hi> Moreover, that <hi>time, times and part of time</hi> in Daniel, is not the ſame ſpace, with the like manner of ſpeaking in Iohn. There it agreeth to the <hi>litle horn;</hi> here, to the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> which being divers, as we have shewed; it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry that one and the ſame ſpace should agree to them both. That deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time in Daniel, anſwereth to that <hi>howr, momenth, &amp; yere,</hi> Apoc. 9.15. al which ſpace, is but a little part of this <hi>time, times, and halfe a time</hi> in the Apocalypſe, as is ſufficiently proved before. VVheras you urge the <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the words;</hi> it is even like as if one would conclude that the Pope is the Turk, becauſe both of them be men, and have dominion over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Moreover, if I ſhould graunt that one thing is handled by them both: yet ſpeaketh not Daniel of one certayn King. You went about to prove ſuch a matter even now; but in vain, as we have ſeen: and the thing it ſelfe, openly proclayms the contrary. For if the <hi>litle horn</hi> were a ſingular perſon, ſuch as by your opinion the other ten muſt needs alſo be: what manner deſcription of the Roman Empire were this, which omitting ſo manie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, should onely touch the eſtate of the laſt three yeres? Nay not of one of the three yeres indeede; ſeing you wil have this Empire to be quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied, before Antichriſt come. Therfore the Scriptures afford you not one word, wherby you may with ſound reaſon conclude that Antichriſt ſhalbe a certain man: but we have by them moſt certenly ſhewed, that it is the apoſtatical ſeat of thoſe that wil dominier in the Church.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>ſecond</hi> argument is from the Fathers; unto whom how should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny give credit when they affirm him to be a certain and ſingular man: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of them knew not, whither he should be a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al, or no? Some wil have him to be the <hi>Divil;</hi> ſome, a <hi>Divil incarnate:</hi> ſome <hi>Nero;</hi> &amp; others, I know not what. And think you that we muſt beleeve theſe men, if they ſay he shalbe a certain perſon? Moreover, ſeing by the ſcriptures, no ſuch thing, but the contrary dooth appear: what account should we make of the uncertain coniecture of men, who ar bidden not to be wiſe <hi>above that which is written?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.6.</p>

                        <p>Theſe therfore I wil leave unmedled with; and very wel might I doo the like with your anſwers unto our men, ſeing they touch none of thoſe things which I have ſet down concerning this matter: yet that you maie perceive your ſelf to be no leſſe weak a fenſer, than you have been a foiner; I wil beſtow on you a little payns in the examining of your anſwers.</p>
                        <p>You propound three arguments of our men: two of Theod. Beza; the third, of Iohn Calvin. Firſt, Beza reaſoneth thus, that <hi>Antichriſt is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one man, becauſe the myſterie of iniquity wrought even in Pauls time, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is to be killed at the coming of Chriſt.</hi> You anſwer, that <hi>Antichriſt began to range abroad in the Apoſtles time, not in his owne perſon, but in his forerunners, to weet, Simon Magus, Nero, and the like.</hi> VVherto I ſay, that Theod. Beza and al our men doo confeſſe the Antichriſt properlie ſo caled, was not in the Apoſtles time, but onely his fore runners. For that which he ſayth, <hi>Let them ſhew me ſome one that continueth alive from Pauls time, unto the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is ſpoken after the common manner, as by way of large amplificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and is to be underſtood of ſome one that should come ſoon after, that age. And was not he to be born shortly after, whoſe forerunners made ſuch a tumult, while the Apoſtles lived? The Apocalypſe ſpeaking of Antichriſt, under that ſeventh head, ſaith, <hi>and the other is not yet come:</hi> cha. 17.10. which manner of words we are wont to uſe in things ſo neer as they may ſeem to be come, though as yet they are not come: and not of things that are to fal out fifteen hundred yeres after. Idle therfore are all thoſe things that you gather of Peter and Paul to be Antichriſts; and of Simon, and Nero to be Chriſts. Why prove you not, I pray you, that the riſing of Antichriſt was not then neer? Is not this ynough to refell his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſon, if he were to beginn a few ages after Paul? But you, like a rude fenſer, bear off with your bukler from the part which you ar not layd at; but where you are beaten even unto death, you leav your ſelf unfenſed and bare. The ſecond argument of Th. Beza is, <hi>that by the ſingular names of Beaſts, the Bear, the Lion, the Libbard in Daniel chap. 7. ar not meant ſingular Kings, but ſingular Kingdomes, wherof one did conteyn even many Kings. After the ſame manner therfore Paul 2 Theſ. 2. who marvelouſly agreeth with Daniel: by the man of ſyn, and ſon of perdition, meaneth not one ſingular perſon, but a certen bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as it were of many tyrants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You anſwer two things: <hi>Firſt denying that Daniel alwayes by ſingular Beaſts, dooth mean ſingular Kingdomes: for in the 8. chapter, by the Ram, he meaneth Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius the laſt King of the Perſians: by the Goat-buck Alexander the Great. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you deny the conſequence of the argument: becauſe Paul, by the man of ſin, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not any of the 4. beaſts deſcribed by Daniel, but onely that litle horn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="508" facs="tcp:6819:262"/>
                        <p>I anſwer to the firſt: It is falſe that which you ſay of the <hi>Ram</hi> and the <hi>Goat-Buck.</hi> For by the <hi>Ram</hi> is meant the whole Kingdome of the Medes &amp; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, and which ended in Darius: by the <hi>Goat-Buck,</hi> the Kingdome of the Greeks, which began by Alexander. For ſo, ſaith he, ver. 3. <hi>there ſtood b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>fore the river one Ram with two hornes; and his two horns were high, but one was higher than an other, and the higheſt came up laſt.</hi> Theſe two hornes, at the two Kingdomes of the Medes and Perſians; of which that was firſt &amp; ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt; this, laſt and largeſt. Have theſe things place in Darius onely, or in the whole Kingdome? Then it foloweth in the next verſe; <hi>I ſaw the Ram pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhing againſt the Weſt, &amp; againſt the North, &amp; againſt the South: ſo that no Beaſts might ſtand before him, neyther did any deliver out of his hand, but he did what he liſted, and that very great things.</hi> What did <hi>Darius</hi> of theſe things; who in the ſecond yere of his reign, being provoked unto warr by Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ruine dayly? Laſt of al, explayning this viſion in the 20. verſe, he ſaith; <hi>The Ram which thou ſaweſt with two horns, are the Kings of Media and Perſia:</hi> he ſaith the <hi>Kings,</hi> not Darius onely. So alſo the <hi>Goat-Buck</hi> is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Greeks; not Alexander alone. He is caled in deed <hi>King of Grae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cia,</hi> ver. 21, but it is playn, that <hi>King</hi> there is taken collectively, as in other places, namely for <hi>Kingdome;</hi> as in the end of the verſe it is taken partitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he ſaith, <hi>the horn between his eyes, is the firſt King;</hi> namely Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; who ſeing he is the <hi>horn,</hi> he is not the whole <hi>Goat.</hi> Wherfore no where in Daniel is a ſingular perſon deſigned by a Beaſt, but a whole Kingdom. Vnto the <hi>ſecond</hi> I ſay. By the <hi>Man of Syn,</hi> is not meant the <hi>litle horn,</hi> but the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> For Antichriſt is the ſeventh head, which alſo is a Beaſt, as Apoc. 17.8.11. And although this Beaſt be none of thoſe that ar in Daniel; yet the argument from the like is firm. For by the ſame reaſon that it is a whole Kingdome in Daniel, it is ſo likeweiſe in the Apocalypſe.</p>
                        <p>Our third argument is Io. Calvins; who thus gathered that Antichriſt is no ſingular perſon; becauſe, <hi>the head of the univerſal Apoſtaſie, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth moe yeres than can be fulfilled under one King, is not one certain man. and An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt is the head of ſuch an Apoſtaſie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You anſwer <hi>five waies, that Calvins impudencie,</hi> as you ſay, <hi>may the more ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peare. Firſt,</hi> that by the <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> may rightly in Paul be underſtood the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> himſelfe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that by the ſame may be meant the defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Roman Empire. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that ther is no need it should be of many ages. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that it requireth not one head. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> that it is yet a queſtion, who have departed from the faith and religion of Chriſt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Papiſts or the Lutherans.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer to every of theſe: and <hi>firſt,</hi> where by the <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> you unner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:6819:262"/> by a metonymie <hi>Antichriſt himſelfe;</hi> you confirm the ſame thing that Calvin ſaith: ſo is your wont, to repreſſe his <hi>impudency.</hi> Vnto the <hi>ſecond,</hi> I ſay, that the Apoſtaſie is not a defection from the Roman Empire, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true faith, to weet, from the love of the holy truth, as Paul openeth it, and as ſhalbe made playn after, chap. 5. and 14. Vnto the <hi>third,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the durance of the Apoſtaſie, we have already learned by the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypſe, that it hath prevailed more than a thouſand two hundred &amp; ſixtie yeres: and this more evidently, than that any of your ſubtil reaſonings ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elude the thing. Vnto the <hi>fourth,</hi> if you can find any other multitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the <hi>whole earth,</hi> which foloweth the Beaſt: I wil not hinder you from ſetting up as many heads of the Apoſtaſie, as you wil, Apoc. 13.3.8. Vnto the <hi>fift,</hi> namely that the queſtion is not yet decided, as you ſay, whither <hi>Papiſts or Lutherans</hi> have made defection; we make this offer, let al holy men be iudges. With whom ther is found Idolatry, let them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of defection, as the Scriptures every where teach. But if any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit be to be give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto the moſt holy oracles of the Scriptures, al that your worship of Images, invocation of Saincts, adoration of the feighned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the ſacrament, veneration of reliques, and many ſuch like things, is horrible Idolatry, and therfore Apoſtaſie. But Idolatry is ſpiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and therfore as the way of the whoriſh woman, which eateth, and then wipeth her mouth, and ſayth, I have doon no iniquity; Prov. 30.20. ſo is the way of Idolaters: by no means can they be brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their impiety. This, Bellarmine, shalbe the true trial, both of you and of us, before God &amp; his holy Angels. The things that you propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, are ridiculous. You wil have it, that we have made defection, becauſe we have departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſuperſtition of our predeceſſours, both in doctrine, and rites ful of Idolatry: as though we were not bidden goe out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and to have no communion with her at al. We have made defection from the whore, defection from Antichriſt, namely defection from your Pope of Rome: but thanks be to God, we have made defection unto the one true God; who of his infinite mercy wil crown our defection with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory, and your conſtancie, if you ſpeedily repent not, with ſempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ignominie, among them which obey not the truth. Now therfore caſt up your accounts, and gather the ſumm; then ſee, foraſmuch as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is an impious and Apoſtatical Kingdome, and the Popes of Rome have been principal Apoſtates, and many; whither <hi>Antichriſt</hi> be a <hi>ſingular perſon or no.</hi>

                        <p>OF Antichriſts coming we gave demonſtrations in the beginning of this refutation; which ſerve to moderate al the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this cauſe, that they may manifeſt the truth of every of them. Yet leaſt this place, where the thing is purpoſely handled, should complayn that it is naked &amp; empty: it shal not be unprofitable, to add unto the former, one reaſon or two, in ſted of th'advantage. And theſe we draw from 2 Theſ. 2. and firſt from the 3. verſe, wher it is ſayd, <hi>except ther come a departing firſt, and that the man of ſyn, the ſon of perdition, be diſcloſed.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down, that both of theſe ſhal goe before the coming of our Lord; &amp; alſo that the <hi>departure</hi> or <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> shal come before the <hi>diſcloſing</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. For that former is the cauſe of this latter, drawing this evil with it, as afterwards he teacheth, that Antichriſt shal therfore come, <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved; ver. 10.11.</hi> Neither should the <hi>diſcloſing</hi> ſtay long after the <hi>defection,</hi> wherunto it is ſtraight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>except ther come a departing firſt, and the man of ſyn be diſcloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But this <hi>departure</hi> began ſecretly even in the Apoſtle time; which is not a defection from the Roman Empire, but a neglect and contempt of the truth received, as the ſame Apoſtle there interpreteth it, and it hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed now through many ages, to be ſeen in the veneration of reliques, the invocation of Saincts, and worship of Images, as was ſaid erewhile. For by ſuch manner of Idolatry, the Lord is forſaken, and men fal from him unto other Gods, as Ieremie ſaith, chap. 16.11. where he is bidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake thus to the people; <hi>Then ſhalt thou ſay unto them, becauſe your Fathers have forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, and have walked after other Gods, and have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and worſhiped them, and have forſaken me, and have not kept my law:</hi> After which manner the other Prophets alſo ſpeake continually. Needs therfore muſt Antichriſt be come long a goe; ſeing the conioined ſigne &amp; cauſe of his coming, hath reigned now in the world many ages.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly;</hi> that impediment is now long ſince taken away, which onely hindred in the Apoſtles time, that the man of ſin was not reveled, ver, 7. Which was not the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> but the <hi>ſixt head</hi> of that Empire; which had the ſupreme government of things whiles Iohn lived; for thus ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Apocalypſe, chap. 17.10. <hi>Five are fallen, one is, the other is not yet come.</hi> That <hi>one,</hi> which the Angel ſaith was then, was the <hi>ſixt King:</hi> with
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:6819:263"/> whom the Roman Empire should not fall, becauſe a <hi>ſeaventh King</hi> &amp; <hi>head</hi> should after ſucceed. Neither did many reign togither with one head: wherupon the <hi>ſeventh</hi> should as wel ſuſteyn the Empire, for his part, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one other of the former. Therfore ſo ſoon as that preſent regiment should be changed, which fel out about two hundred yeres after Iohn, then that weighty burden, which hitherto did reſtreyn, being removed, Antichriſt should come forth, and converſe in al mens ſight.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if the myſterie of iniquity wrough whiles the Apoſtles lived, of neceſsity the birth could not be farr of, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paynes of bringing forth did vex ſo betimes 2 Theſ. 2.7. Otherwiſe what a monſtrous thing is this, that one should be a breeding in the body theſe fifteen hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres, and yet the yongling is not brought forth; and when at laſt he shal come forth, he shal be but a King for three yeres and ſix moneths? But theſe ar dreams. If the Apoſtles ſcarſely repreſſed him, much leſſe did they keepe him in which came after, and which had leſſe piety, knowledge, ſtudie, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: whoſe gifts alſo decaying daylie more and more, made way for the ſpeedy riſing and increaſing of the <hi>Man of ſyn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe things being thus layd down, now come we unto yours: which is but one onely argument about this matter. Long inough in deed it is, for it reacheth from the beginning of the chapter to the end: but it is no leſſe weake and feeble, then long and tedious. Thus it goeth: <hi>Antichriſt is not yet come, becauſe he came not at the time which ſome both of the ancient &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men have ſuppoſed.</hi> The ancient men you mention are <hi>the Theſſalonians, Cy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prian, Ierom. Gregorie, one Iudas, Lactantius, and a Biſhop of Florence:</hi> the later are, <hi>the Samoſatenians of Hungarie, and Tranſilvania, Jllyricus, Chytreus, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Bulinger, Muſculus.</hi> And in folowing this matter, is the whole chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpent. I anſwe twofold; firſt falſe it is, that he which cam not in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſpoken of by the ſayd authors, is not yet come. It was not neceſſary that they should know the firſt riſing &amp; original of Antichriſt. The Beaſt remayneth a <hi>Myſterie</hi> after his diſcloſing, Apoc. 17.7. whoſe perſon was manifeſt, but not his wickednes and original. Eor the <hi>Myſterie</hi> were taken away, if that which lay hidd within, should lye open unto al men. And as Gods Kingdom, though foretold by the Prophets, came not with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Luk 17.20. ſo neyther dooth Antichriſts Kingdome. The tares are ſowen, whiles the husbandmen ſleep, Mat. 13.25. neither were they perceived in the firſt ſpringing: but were they not therfore, becauſe the husband-men knew not which way they grew? Shal we not acknowledge the motion of the ſun, becauſe we perceive it not as it moveth? Doubtleſſe the craftie enemy, of his ingenious diſpoſition had much rather that his
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:6819:264"/> Vicar ſhould invade men privilie, wherby he might oppreſſe the moe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares: than that rushing upon them with noiſe and tumult, he should give men a ſign for to looke to themſelves. Moreover, when you conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that he is not <hi>yet come;</hi> you ſhould have comprehended al the other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and not thoſe few onely, which the ſaid ancient and later men doo mention. Is not one come in ſome day, becauſe he is not come in the firſt, or ſecond, or third houre therof? It is a fault in reckning up the parts, to paſſe by anie one: and ſeing you have omitted manie, your propoſition is made diverſe wayes abſurd, and the whole argumentation that hangeth thereon.</p>
                        <p>Secondly I anſwer ſeverally to the reſt; and firſt concerning the anci<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>et Fathers, from whoſe words, we doo more then probably conclude, that Antichriſt is come. For thus ſaith Cyprian, lib, 4. Epiſt. 6. <hi>You ought to know, and for certayn to beleeve and hold, that the day of vexation is begun to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our heads; and that the fal of the world and time of Antichriſt is at hand.</hi> Ierom in his Epiſtle to Ageruchia, concerning Monogamie, ſaith, <hi>He that did hold is taken out of the way, and doo we not underſtand that Antichriſt is neer?</hi> Alſo Gregory lib. 4. Epiſt. 38. <hi>All things foretold, are come to paſſe; the King of prid is neer.</hi> For if Antichriſt were neer thirteen hundred yeres agoe, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at the leaſt; as is evident by theſe teſtimonies: how can it be that he is not yet come? You anſwer, <hi>that the ancient Fathers were deceived, with opinion that the worlds end was neerer, than in deede it was: and that therfore Antichriſt was then neer in falſe opinion, not in very deed.</hi> Wherunto I ſay, If the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers had grounded their ſentence upon the perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely of the worlds end; it muſt needs have been, as they erred in this, ſo alſo they had erred in Antichriſt: but ſeing they perſuaded themſelves ſo by other argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, and gathered, not ſo much that Antichriſt was neer, becauſe the end of the world was at hand, as that the worlds end was at hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Antichriſt was neer; needs muſt that be firm and ſtable which they avouched of this thing, unleſſe beſide that vain opinion, you can prov the other reaſons alſo to be light. But it is manifeſt by their words, that they had ſuſpicion of the worlds end, by Antichriſts coming, not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryweiſe. For Ierome reaſoneth from <hi>the impediment taken away, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was neer. He that held,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is taken out of the way; and doo we not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Antichriſt is neer?</hi> Gregorie by the <hi>fulfilling all things that were foretold:</hi> than which, what can be a more certayn argument? And you con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>al the ancients, minding the evilnes of their times, ſuſpected that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts times were at hand.</hi> They did not therfore upon ſuſpicion of the end, conclude of Antichriſt. For the laſt end is never made a ſigne of things
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:6819:264"/> going before, but the things that goe before are determined to be ſignes of the laſt end. The end ſeing it is the laſt and the moſt unknown, even to the Angels in heaven, and to the Son of man himſelfe Mark 13.32. can give no fore-perceiving of things that are before &amp; more known. By ſure argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts therfore they knew that Antichriſt was at hand: but that which they joyned therto of the laſt end, relyed but upon an unſure &amp; humane conjecture. They had received from Clemens Alexandrinus Strom. lib. 1. a falſe Chronologie of five thouſand, ſeven hundred, foure skore &amp; foure yeres, two moneths and twelve dayes paſt from Adam unto the death of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus the Emperour. Therunto was added an opinion of the worlds durance ſix thouſand yeres: wherupon Cyprian in the preface de exhort. Martyr. ſaith, <hi>the ſix thouſand yeres are now almoſt fulfilled, ſince the Divil impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned man.</hi> And Lactantius lib. 7. cap. 25. Divinar. Inſtitut. <hi>All exſpectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeemeth to be more than of two hundred yeres.</hi> Add unto theſe, the conjecture of the worlds ſpeedy end, after Antichriſts coming, and then it will eaſily appear, that great difference ther is, between thoſe things which are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled of Antichriſt, and of the end of the world. The firſt they had found out by many Propheſies, and undoubted ſignes: the later they did perſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade themſelves, by ſome likelyhood of truth, and the infirme authority of men.</p>
                        <p>The like we doo ſee in Chriſts diſciples, which exſpected as we knowe a temporal Kingdome. Yet when they preached that Chriſt was come, &amp; that the Kingdome was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be reſtored to Iſrael; ſhould any which ſaw not the Kingdom reſtored; diſanull their faith touching Chriſts coming? ſurely he should doo them wrong. For that Chriſt was come, they knew by moſt ſure arguments, which could not deceive: but their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the temporal Kingdom, they drew from the dreggs of the common error. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo, the ancient Fathers, underſtood by true ſignes from the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that Antichriſt was at the dores: but that which they affirmed of the laſt end, was of their own; &amp; should not diminiſh the credit of that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is joyned. Therfore you have not eſcaped by this your anſwer, but by the ſentence of the ancient Fathers, it remayneth firm and ſtedfaſt that Antichriſt is come: and therfore it was not for nought, that the Bishop of Florence one of your owne men, openly avouched five hundred yeres agoe, that Antichriſt was then come: to ſtop whoſe mouth, the Councel of Florence was gathered. But you thought it better, that the fame of this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil should rather come u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to poſterity, than that the acts therof ſhould come unto their knowledge.</p>
                        <p>As touching the later men, in the firſt place you mention the <hi>Samoſate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
                           <pb n="514" facs="tcp:6819:265"/> of Hungary: whith whom I wil have nothing to doo. Whatſoever they think or think not, is al one to me: until they return unto ſoundnes of mind. The other learned men have a threefold difference: <hi>Illyricus, Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus, and Luther,</hi> make Antichriſts coming to be about the yere of our L. 500. <hi>Bullinger,</hi> at the yere 763. <hi>Muſculus,</hi> about the yeere 1200. Surely the ſecond riſing of the Beaſt, in whoſe territories they remayned, did caſt ſo ſtrong a ſmel, to thoſe prudent men, that they could retch their minds to no further thing: even as hownds, which when they fal upon the denn of the wild beaſt, doo run with ful courſe and cry, not ſenting anie more the ſeveral footſteps. Therfore for the moſt part they transfer unto this ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cond riſing, the things which belong to the firſt, and bring in here ſome other things that are not to the purpoſe. Nevertheleſſe, this light aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the time of his riſing, taketh not away his riſing: but by their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and cryes, we know that Antichriſt is; though the moment when firſt he began to be, was hidd from them. Let us therfore run through your anſwers unto every of them; that you may perceive how they have not ſo much erred, as your ſelfe have laboured in vayn, in oppugning their jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly</hi> therfore you encounter with Illyricus, who ſaith, Antichriſt was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> born, when Phocas gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to the Biſhop of Rome, that he ſhould be caled <hi>Head</hi> of the whole Church, which fel out in the yere 606. You an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer; <hi>that he was not born at this time, for two cauſes: firſt, becauſe Antichriſts temporal reign of 666. yeres, which Illyricus would have to begin at that ariſing; ſhould now long ſince be ended, and Antichriſt ſhould be dead. Secondly, that by his ſpiritual reign, which Illyricus wil have to be of 5260 yeres, the Centurie writers might exactly know the end of the world; contrary to our Lords words Acts. 1. &amp; Mat. 24.</hi> I anſwer unto the <hi>firſt:</hi> It is a fooliſh thing which you gather of Antichriſts death, at the end of 666. yeres: when you ſee they give unto him a ſpiritual reign of 1260. yeres. Can any one reigne 594. yeres, (for ſo many is this reign proroged beyond the temporal,) after he is dead? But perhaps your ſpiritual Pope hath no more vital life without tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, then the ſerpent hath without duſt.</p>
                        <p>Vnto the <hi>ſecond</hi> I anſwer, it is as lawful for the Centurie writers exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know the yere when the world ſhal end: as it is for your Papiſts, to know the very day. Doo not you recken 1335. dayes, from the beginning of Antichriſts reign, unto the laſt judgment? Shal that ſpeech of Chriſt touching this unknown day, have no longer place than til Antichriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth? Mark 13.32. How then ſhal it come as a ſnare upon al that dwel on the face of al the earth? Luk. 21.33. Your refutation therfore is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:6819:265"/> We have shewed that that firſt number is not of his <hi>Reigne,</hi> but of his <hi>nam:</hi> &amp; that the other is to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>firſt</hi> coming of Antic. not from the <hi>ſecond.</hi> But I wilbe no longer now about this matter: I return a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayn to you, &amp; doo grant that which you ſtrive for. Be it, that Antichriſt was not then firſt born. I ask this onething of you; whither was he then or no? If you deny him then to be; I thus convince it. Then was the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pediment</hi> taken away, which onely hindred his coming, as Ierom even now affirmed. Then <hi>al things were doon, which were foretold ſhould goe before his coming;</hi> as Gregorie did avouch. Then was ther an <hi>Vniverſal Prieſt,</hi> ſuch as the ſame Gregory confidently ſayth, <hi>whoſoever caleth himſelfe, or deſireth to be caled, he is in his pride the forerunner of Antichriſt.</hi> lib. 7. Epiſt. 194. unto Mauricius. But, if he that deſireth ſuch a name be the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Antichriſt: what shal we cal him that hath the name? Seing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichriſt was at that time: now look you how he is not yet come.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Jn the third place</hi> you anſwer to Chytreus, who maketh his birth to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame time; eſpecially, becauſe Gregorie at this time ſtabliſhed prayer to Saincts, and Maſſes for the dead &amp;c. To this you ſay, that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory was not the firſt that taught to pray unto the Saincts, and to offer Maſſes for the dead. For al the ancient Fathers taught the ſame;</hi> and in ſted of al you bring forth one <hi>Ambroſe, which was two hundred yere before Gregorie.</hi> I anſwer, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely Chytreus erred, that though Antichriſt to be ſome yeres yonger, then in deede he was. He was much more ancient, but did ſo bear his age, that as an other <hi>Cupid</hi> he alwayes ſeemed to be a childe. For the man was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his ſecond riſing, wherby he revived from the dead: and as <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of an old man became a yong; ſo he fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> youth returned to his cradle. Neither ſhould it be ſtrange to have him then accounted <hi>firſt,</hi> who then ſeemed to be <hi>new.</hi> But you ſo deny his birth, as you add yeres to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, &amp; take none away: as if you should require inheritance for a ward, and be afraid, leaſt he should goe too late out of his wardship.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly</hi> you come to Luther, who makes a double coming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; one with a ſpiritual ſword, after the yere 600. an other with a tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral ſword, after the yere 1000. You anſwer, that the <hi>Popes depoſed Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and made warrs before the thouſand yere.</hi> I anſwer, therfore thou Luther alſo waſt deceived: Antichriſt was come before thou ſuppoſeſt. Surely you ſo defend the Popes, as if one being charged with theft, to avoide the crime should openly crye, that that was not the firſt thing that he had ſtollen; but for many other greater things had he plaid the theef before. You feared not, as it ſeemeth, that any should afterwards come, which would ſearch out the higher origine of Antichriſt.</p>
                        <pb n="516" facs="tcp:6819:266"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Bullinger ſo expoundeth that number 666. as to deſigne the yere of Antichriſt coming, after the writing of the Apocalypſe, namely the yere of our Lord 763. To which you anſwer, and rightly, that <hi>this is the number of Antichriſts name, not of his time.</hi> Though from hence your cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe have but litle help. For although he were not then firſt born, yet he mought be born before: which ſufficiently sheweth, that you falſly doo avouch, He was not yet come.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixtly,</hi> Muſculus affirmeth that Antichriſt came about the yere 1200. moved hereunto by Bernards authoritie, who ſaith after manie other things, wherwith he bewayleth the wickednes of thoſe times, <hi>Jt remayneth that the man of ſyn be reveled.</hi> Serm. 6. of Pſal. 90. You anſwer two things, <hi>firſt that Bernards ſuſpicion was falſe, as was Cyprians, Ieroms, Gregories, in their times. For he ſuſpected by the evils which he ſaw, that Antichriſt was neer. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ther were worſer Popes without any compariſon, in the former age than in that.</hi> I anſwer to the <hi>firſt,</hi> you fayrlie contradict the Apoſtle. He teacheth that the Apoſtaſie goeth before Antichriſt: and that he should come into the world for mens deſpiſing the love of the truth: declaring therby, that ther is no more evident ſigne both of Antichriſt approching &amp; reigning; than that al kind of hypocritical impietie licenciouſly rangeth abroad. You wil have Bernard to be deceived, and that he ſuſpected by the evils which he ſaw, that Antichriſt was neer. In verie deed he was deceived in that he thought him to be but neer, and not preſent. Otherwiſe he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged more ſyncerely of Antichriſt; than the Ieſuites are wont; or any other Papiſts. Vnto the <hi>ſecond</hi> I ſay, ſeing they were worſer in the age before, we gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you that his firſt birth did not now beginn, but having been brought forth long before, now onely he was exſtant. And thus, when al comes to al, you have diſputed this queſtion, as if one should contend, that the Sun is not riſen at noon day, though it began to shine in the horiſon at ſix a clock in the morning: becauſe it neither roſe at eight a clock, as one affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; nor at nine, as the ſecond, nor at ten, as the third avouched By the verie like argument, you and yours would perſwade, that Antichriſt is not yet come.</p>

                        <p>For a groundwork of the <hi>firſt demonſtration,</hi> you ſet down that which is written Mat. 24.14. <hi>this Goſpel of the Kingdome ſhalbe preached in the whole world, for a teſtimonie to al nations:</hi> from which an argument is thus framed; which let me, I pray you, bring into form, that we of the ruder ſort may more eaſily obſerv the art of demonſtration. He that is to come after the preaching of the Goſpel in al the world, he is not yet come: Antichriſt is to come after the preaching of the Goſpel in al the world: therfore he is not yet come. This is your demonſtration, wherin we find manie ſtrange and new points, never delivered by any Demonſtrating Maſters: namely, that principles are uſed for demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration, which be neither true nor firſt. For as touching truth, the propoſition is eyther manifeſtly falſe, or at leaſt doubtful, as after more plainly shal appear, and therfore not meet for a demonſtration. Moreover, if any would doubt of the minor, what ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth hath it from Mathew? what one word is ther in him of Antichriſt to come after a general preaching? How is this an immediate principle, which if it have any credit, muſt borow it from elſewhere? Pardon, I pray you, this my moroſitie. I thought it neceſſary to make trial of ſome one of your de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monſtrations: of al which, ſeing we have now a pattern in this firſt, wee shal not need to deal ſo exactly in the reſt, but may judge of what ſorte al are, by the nature of this. But your ſelfe ſaw, how trifling and unworthy a demonſtration this was; and therfore you flee unto a probable reaſon, which as a propp you put under that readie to fall. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme the Minor, that Antichriſt is to come after the general preaching, leaving now Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, whole name at firſt was vainly obtruded; <hi>Jt may be proved,</hi> you ſay, <hi>by reaſon: becauſe in Antichriſts time, the cruelty of the laſt perſecution, wil hinder al publick exerciſes of true religion.</hi> I anſwer, how truly this is ſaid of the publick ceaſing of religion, we shal ſee after in the chapter of <hi>Perſecution.</hi> In the mean while I avouch that you diſpute not ſo much unskilfully, as in deed falſly. For <hi>time</hi> is threefold; paſt, preſent, and to come: neyther can anie thing be concluded that it is to come, unleſſe it be before proved, that it
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:6819:267"/> is neither preſent, nor paſt. Wil you then infer that Antichriſt shal come after the general preaching, becauſe he cannot be togither with the ſame? But why, I pray you, may he not be before it? Yea what if by this your de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he muſt needs be before it? Surely neither can he be togither with the general preaching, for the crueltie of perſecution, as you ſay: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he come after, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>when the Goſpel is preached in the whole world, then ſhal come the end.</hi> You ſee nothing to come between the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal preaching &amp; the end. Therfore by this your reaſon, he muſt needs come before the univerſal preaching. This is not the leaſt vertue of this undoubted demonſtration; that it maketh more for your adverſaries cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, than for your own.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the adverſaries admitt not of this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Surely nor your freinds, I beleev, unleſſe it be ſome foxes, that prayſe the crow for his ſweet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. But I am glad for you, that at laſt your ſelfe are weary of this demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Furthermore you ſay, <hi>Neither is there time now to deduce it from the principles therof, and therfore you wil prove the thing by teſtimonies of the Fathers.</hi> What? Have not you time, which undertake the moſt copious handling of all controverſies? And, which bring not forth one argument of anie weight, in this cauſe? I know your Ieſuitical cunning: what you can not doo, for needynes; that you may not doo for haſt unto other matters. But let us goe forward and ſee, how you folow both parts of the former argument. For the new, as it ſeemeth, affordeth nothing; but the old neſt was to be trimmed, that ſome ſhew of building might appear. Firſt therfore you bring <hi>Hilarie, Cyrill, Theodoret, Damaſcen,</hi> affirming, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhal not come, til after an univerſal preaching.</hi> I anſwer, ther is now no need curiouſly to inquire into their ſayings, ſeing in this thing they teach agreably to the ſcriptures. For Antichriſt was to come, becauſe the love of the truth was refuſed, 2 Theſ 2. And the puniſhment is not inflicted before the fault. Neither could the fault be committed, before there was the uſe of the truth. Here therfore I contradict nothing. Moreover, in ſome ſort I doo grant your proof from the text. For the Goſpel was to be preached before that great tribulation ſpoken of Mat. 24.21. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you err, that you think this is both the laſt tribulation, and the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Antichriſt. For it is no other than the deſtruction of Ieruſalem; as Chryſoſtome alſo dooth acknowledge, though typically he would hav it referred unto Antichriſt. Let Antichriſt therfore come after the univer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſal preaching of the Goſpel. But what? Hath not the Goſpel been noiſed as yet through al the world? In deede ſo you ſay; though the thing it ſelf be otherweiſe. Chriſt being to aſcend into heaven, bade the Apoſtles to
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:6819:267"/> 
                           <hi>goe into al the world,</hi> Mark 16.25. And promiſed that <hi>they ſhould be his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes unto the utmoſt end of the earth,</hi> Act. 1.8. It can not be, eyther that the Apoſtles ſhould neglect that which was commanded; or that our Lord should not performe that which he promiſed. Neither wanted the thing an iſſue, as the Apoſtle teacheth, ſaying that the faith of the Romanes, <hi>was publiſhed through the whole world,</hi> Rom. 1.8. and that the Goſpel <hi>was come unto the Coloſſeans, even as unto al the world,</hi> Col. 1.6.23. You anſwer, <hi>that the whole world in theſe places, is not properly and ſimply taken, but figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but the Goſpel ſhould be preached in everie nation properly and ſimplie, before An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt come.</hi> Which you prove by teſtimony of Fathers, and by three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The Fathers are Auguſtine, Origen, and Ierom; beſides thoſe fore-alledged. I anſwer, Ther is no doubt but the Fathers doo accommodate their words, unto the words of the Scriptures; and therfore they often ſay, that the Goſpel should be preached <hi>in al the world, through the whole earth, in al lands &amp;c.</hi> but whither they ſpeake more expreſſely or no, &amp; doo ſignify by name that theſe kind of ſpeeches are to be taken ſimply, not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively, may wel be doubted. Ierom in his Epiſtle to Ageruchia ſaith, <hi>He that held, is taken out of the way, and doo we not underſtand that Antichriſt is neer?</hi> By which it is playn, that he underſtood no other preaching thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh the whole world, than ſuch as was in his time: for otherweiſe, how could Antichriſt be neer? So Gregorie, as is before mentioned, ſaith, <hi>Al things that were fore-told are come to paſſe: the King of pride is nigh.</hi> Therfore this univerſal preaching was then doon; but not properly as you would have it, which as you ſay, is not performed to this day. Turn over the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therfore, and weigh their words more diligently: perhaps though theſe things were very dark unto them, you ſhal finde no ſuch preaching with them, as you doo dream of.</p>
                        <p>Of the three reaſons which you bring, the firſt is, that, <hi>the preaching in al the world, is a ſigne, Chriſt ſaith, of the end of the world: for ſo he annexeth,</hi> &amp; then ſhal come the end. <hi>But if the Goſpel ſhould not be preached in the whole world pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly, but by comprehenſion of a part for the whole, the ſigne would be of no value. For in that manner the Goſpel was preached by the Apoſtles through al the world, in the firſt twenty yeres.</hi> I anſwer; wheras from theſe words you affirme, that the preaching in al the world, is a ſigne of the end of the world: this is yours, Bellarmine, not Chriſts. He ſaith no more but <hi>and then ſhal come the conſummation,</hi> or the <hi>end.</hi> That, <hi>of the world,</hi> he addeth not. Neither is the end or conſummation wherof he ſpeaketh, of the <hi>world,</hi> but of the <hi>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Iewiſh politie:</hi> the law wherof was abrogated in Chriſts death, but now alſo by diſsipation of the nation, the whole uſe ſhould be taken
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:6819:268"/> away. For the Diſciples inquired of a twofold end, ver. 3. of the <hi>temple,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>world.</hi> Of the firſt, Chriſt anſwereth unto the 23. verſe: of the later, in the reſt of the chapter, under the name of his coming. Neither had he ſatiſfied the demaunds, unleſſe he had comprehended both. Wherfore that univerſal preaching, was a ſigne of Ieruſalems deſtruction, the neerer token wherof was <hi>the abomination of deſolation,</hi> fore-told by Daniel: which being next added, may teach, of what end the former words doo ſpeake. For Chriſt anſwereth not ſo confuſedly and intricately, as that from the laſt end of the world, he would ſtraightway leap back againe to the Iewes affayres. Seing therfore in this place he ſpeaketh of this conſummation, and not of any other: ther is no neceſsity that the preaching through the whole world, ſhould be properly.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>ſecond</hi> reaſon is: <hi>that properly al nations are promiſed to Chriſt, Pſal. 71. All nations ſhal ſerv him: therfore the preaching ought to be general properly.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; I deny not but all nations ſhalbe gathered unto Chriſt, and that by a general preaching properly, before he come unto judgement. For prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching is that ſilver trumpet which is appointed for the gathering togither of the elect: and I find in the Scriptures a twofold general preaching, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurativ, and proper; as in the end of this chapter I wil more fully declare. But what is this, to the coming of Antichriſt? It is shewed, that he is com a thouſand and three hundred yeres agoe. Alſo his deſtruction, shalbe a long ſpace before the laſt iudgement, as shalbe shewed after, chap. 9. <hi>Of the end of the world,</hi> and in the reſt of the enarration of this Apocalypſe. Therfore that may be before Chriſts coming, which shal folow after An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts deſtruction. And in verie deed, the general preaching shal not be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginn, before Antichriſt be at an end; or at leaſt be ready ſoon after to dye. The times may not be confounded; nor that which is proper to one, be tranſferred to an other.</p>
                        <p>Your <hi>third</hi> reaſon is, <hi>That the Goſpel ſhalbe preached in the whole world, for a teſtimonie to al nations. Therfore a general preaching muſt goe before the general iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gement.</hi> I anſwer; This argument is one with the former, but that it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort diſtinguiſhed in the ſubiects. That treated of the ſalvation of the elect; this, of the iuſt condemnation of the reprobates. But the anſwer is one. For I grant, a general preaching muſt goe before the general judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but when you shal have proved that the <hi>general iudgement,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> are things ſo conioyned, as that which goeth before the one, muſt needs alſo goe before this other: then wil I eaſily grant you, that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preaching muſt properly goe before Antichriſt. And now as if you had put the matter out of al controverſie, you goe in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to anſwer unto Paul
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:6819:268"/> concerning thoſe wores Rom. 10.18. <hi>Their ſound is gone out unto al the earth:</hi> the interpretation wherof you bring from Auguſtine, Ierom, &amp; Thomas. The ſumme is, that they are to be underſtood figuratively. VVhich you might eaſily have obteyned, without ſo much a doo. Ther is no man but granteth, that the like Scriptures fore-alledged, are not to be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly. But if Paul ſpeak figurativelie, why maie not Chriſt likeweiſe? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not abſurd,</hi> you ſay, <hi>if we grant that our Lord ſpake properly, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle figuratively. For the reaſons wherby we are compelled to take our Lords in a proper ſignification, have not the ſame force, if they be applyed to Pauls words; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſeing our Lord ſpake of a thing to come, and Paul of a thing paſt.</hi> I anſwer; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>end</hi> wherof Chriſt ſpake, was onely of the citie, not of the whole earth; to weet, of Ieruſalem, not of the world: ther is no reaſon which more compelleth us to take our Lords words in a proper ſignification, then thoſe words of Paul, in the Epiſtle to the Romanes ch. 1. verſe 8. Coloſſ. 1.6.23. ſpoken of before. For wheras you ſay, that Paul Ro. 10.18. ſpeaketh of a thing paſt: you might have remembred from Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, that <hi>he tooke the time paſt, for that which was to come, as David did whoſe words they are,</hi> as you wrote a litle before: and that ſo the Prophets are wont to ſpeake almoſt everie where, of things to come, as if they wer paſt. In the other Scriptures, Paul ſpeaketh of that thing performed, which our Lord foretold should be performed. This your firſt demonſtration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is altogither lame, having no certaintie, no truth: but it is ſuch a ſigne, (in the ſenſe that you would have the preaching to be taken,) of Antichr. to come, as the Iewes have feighned to themſelves of Chriſt to come; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely ſuch as mans bold ignorance hath feighned, without anie authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the oracle of God. Wherfor ſeing you have written nothing right of this matter, I wil endvour to shew ſome ſurer thing, as even now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, wherby the readers maie have what to think concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vniverſal preaching</hi> therfore is twofold; as I ſaid; figurative and proper. The firſt was given to the Apoſtles for a ſigne of the Iewiſh deſolation; &amp; ſo likewiſe should goe before the Antichriſt, who should not come forth until ſome ages after al that Politie was utterly extinguished. The later, which we cal general properlie, shal not goe before Antichriſt, but folow. For after he is ſlayn, the Goſpel shalbe spredd farr and wide, even unto thoſe nations which as yet never had the hearing of it. For then <hi>ſhal the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions bring their glory and honour unto the new holie citie, Apoc. 21.24. Then ſhal the tree grow amidds the ſtreet of the heavenly citie, whoſe leaves ſhal miniſter cure and health unto the nations, Apoc. 22.2. Then ſhal the temple be opened, into
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:6819:269"/> which no forreyner could enter during the ſeven plagues with which Antichriſt is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumed, Apoc. 15.8. and chap. 16. Then ſhal the waters flow out of the temple towards the Eaſt, and unto al the countrie round about; by whoſe wholſomnes, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great multitude of fiſh ſhalbe ingendred Ezech. 47. And then after the litle horn is taken away, the Kingdom ſhalbe given to one like the ſon of man, that al peoples, nations, tongues, may ſerv him, Dan. 7.14.</hi> which Kingdome is not that which shalbe in heaven, where no diſtinction is of peoples, nations and tongues: but ſhal come in earth, and be adminiſtred by the ſcepter of his word. Wherupon after the cutting off of this <hi>Horn,</hi> (which men commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doo interpret, partly of Antiochus, partly of Antichriſt, but is in verie deed the Turk, who shalbe rooted out within a while after the true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt;) ther shalbe a moſt ample promulgation of the Goſpel, with much larger limits, than ever heretofore. For <hi>then all the nations indeede ſhal ſerve him</hi> Pſal. 72.11. <hi>and Jehovah ſhalbe King over all the earth; and in that day, ſhall Iehovah be one, and his name one,</hi> Zach. 14.19.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things and many ſuch like doo make it playn, that howſoever the doctrine of ſalvation ſurveyed many lands before Antichriſt: yet after he is extinguished, the tents of the ſacred truth, shalbe much more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply diſplayed; ſo that into them shal aſſemble a very great congregation, in reſpect wherof the aſſemblies of former times have been ſmal, or rather none. Theſe things doo the ſcriptures teach of the univerſal preaching, &amp; they are conſtant, firm, ſure, ful of maieſty, power, mercy, if you look un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God; and if you turn your eies unto our ſelves, they are no leſſe full of al joy and confort. Wheras on the contrarie, the things which you have brought, are either uncertayn gueſſes, or vaine fictions: which wil both deceive, at leaſt, your expectation, and in the mean while, lead into error and deſtruction.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond Demonſtration,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is taken from the other ſigne that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the times of Antichriſt, which ſhalbe the utter deſolation of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which ſeing it yet endureth, Antichriſt is not yet come.</hi> Hereupon you take in hand to prove two things; firſt <hi>that Antichriſt ſhal not come til after the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſolation of the Romane Empire:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>that the Romane Empire dooth yet indure.</hi> The firſt you confirm by fowr ſcriptures: of which, the three firſt, namely Dan. 2. and 7. Apoc. 17. doo rely upon the interpretation of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaeus, book 5. But let us leav, I pray you, mens names, and let us weigh the thing it ſelfe, in the ballance of truth. If the matter ſhould be diſcuſſed by the contrary opinions of men, which might be found many in theſe
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:6819:269"/> dark places; ther would be no end. Let us deal rather from ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as may lead and bring us to ſome certainty.</p>
                        <p>As touching therfore the 2. of Daniel, and that ſucceſsion of the chief Kingdomes until the worlds end, which the Images sheweth, nothing out <hi>by the golden head, the ſylver breſt, the brazen belly, the leggs, and the feet partly y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and partly clay; the 4. cheif Kingdoms on earth, of the Aſsyrians, Perſians, Greeks, Romanes; the laſt wherof the Romane</hi> you ſay, <hi>was a long time parted in two, as the leggs are two and long. Moreover that of the two leggs ſhould ſpring ten toes, and in them the whole Jmage have an end: to weet becauſe the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſhould at laſt be divided into ten Kings, of whom none ſhould be King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, as no toe is a leg.</hi> As touching theſe, I ſay, what one word is ther in al this viſion, which intimateth that Antichriſt should come after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire is utterly defaced? I hear there are tow leggs, and the feet divided into ten toes; but not a whit concerning Antichriſt, whither he should come after this diviſion, or before it, or in the time of the diviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Doo you goe on thus to build your Demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrations, without any ſo much as ſhew of a foundation wheron they should rely? Yea what if the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may from hence moſt firmly be concluded, that Antichriſt shal come before Chriſt cometh? But the Romane Empire shal not altogither be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, until Chriſt be come. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feet of iron and clay shal dure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſtone out of the mountayn, cutt without hands, shal ſmite them &amp; beat them to peeces, as is plainly shewed, ver. 34. <hi>thou ſaweſt until a ſtone was cut out, which is not in any hands, and ſmote the image on his feet of yron and clay, and brake them to peeces:</hi> and agayn in the 44. verſe, <hi>And in the dayes of theſe Kings shall the God of Heaven ryſe up a Kingdome, which shall never be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroyed</hi> &amp;c. But theſe feet, are the Romane Empire: weaker in deed than it was before, of the leggs; yet is it the Romane Empire notwithſtanding. For the Image deciphreth <hi>fowr</hi> Kingdomes onely: but if the <hi>feet</hi> should have an other Kingdome than the <hi>leggs,</hi> ther should be <hi>five.</hi> Wherupon alſo that is falſe which you ſay, that <hi>the Romane Empire ſhal at laſt be divided into ten Kings, of which none ſhalbe King of the Romanes, as no toe is a leg.</hi> For thus you bring in a <hi>fift</hi> Kingdome, which the Spirit by the Image ſayth not. Neither is that of weight, <hi>that a toe is not a leg:</hi> ſeing no one member is an other, though both be parts of one whole thing, even as the toe and legg, be of the fourth Kingdome. Now therfore you may ſee, how fayrly you have made demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration of your nakednes; which the more you ſeek to cover and hide, the more conſpicuous and filthy you doo make it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond place is out of Dan. 7.7. where,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the ten hornes which come out of the laſt Beaſt, are the ten laſt Kings which ſhal ariſe out of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:6819:270"/> but shal not be Romane Emperours: as the hornes ariſe out of the Beaſt, but ar not the Beaſt it ſelfe.</hi> I anſwer, as even now I did to the former argument, which was the ſelfe ſame that this. If theſe ten hornes have a Kingdome divers from that of the Beaſt: then ar ther not <hi>fowr</hi> Kings onely, but <hi>five;</hi> contrary to that the Angel affirmeth, ver. 17. <hi>theſe great Beaſts which are fowr are fowr Kings, which ſhal riſe out of the earth.</hi> Moreover, doo you think that <hi>the 4. hornes of the Goat, which roſe up in place of that broken horn,</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other diſtinct Kingdome from the Kingdome of the Goat, to weet, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of the Greeks? Dan. 8.8. If ſo you think, the Prophet ſheweth you are playnly deceived, who teacheth that this <hi>Goat</hi> of the 8. chapter, is the <hi>Leopard</hi> of the ſeventh: and that the <hi>Leopard</hi> is one Kingdome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the third: chap. 7.6.17. As therfore the Goats horns make not a different Kingdome from the Kingdome of the Goat: ſo neither doe the <hi>ten horns of the fourth Beaſt</hi> make a different Kingdome of the 4 Beaſt. Ther be alſo the ten horns of the Dragon, in this Apocalypſe, which are not re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bellious Princes agaiſt the Dragon, but his cheif defenders, legates, and adminiſtrators, by whoſe help he moſt exerciſed his tyranny, Apoc. 12.3. Beſides, the <hi>ten horns</hi> ar not the diſſolution of that Empire, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remayneth after they are riſen up. But ſo the viſion teacheth evidently, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> (namely the fourth) should not be ſlayn and his body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, before the horn, which ſpringeth up after thoſe ten wer broken and taken away, Dan. 7.11. Wherfore the ten horns, doo no way ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the diſsipation and fal of the Roman Empire, wherby to afford us any help, for the finding out of Antichriſts coming. Vnto theſe may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that which this argument hath common with the former, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is ther any mention of Antichriſt here. In deed the <hi>litle horn</hi> growes up after the reſt; and ſome learned men doo apply it hither: but neither doo your ſelfe now inſiſt upon this horn; and we have shewed before, in the ſecond chapter herof, that this expoſition is untrue.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The third place</hi> is out of Apoc. 17.16. where <hi>the ten hornes</hi> you wil have to be <hi>ten Kings, which shal reigne togither; but shal not be Romanes, becauſe theſe Kings shal hate the whore and make her deſolate, and ſo shal divide the Romane Empire among themſelves, and utterly deſtroy it.</hi> I anſwer, It is even marvelous that you ſee not the playn contrarie to that you intended, here proved. For if this hatred, wherwith the ten Kings shal hate the whore &amp; make her deſolate, be the fal and ruine of the Romane Empire, then ſhal Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt come before the Romane Empire be deſolate. For ther shalbe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred long before this, and the ten Kings shal ſerve her a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shal thus riſe up in wrath againſt the whore, according to that
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:6819:270"/> which is written ver. 12.13. <hi>And the ten hornes which thou ſeweſt, are ten Kings, which have not yet received a Kingdome, but shal receive power as Kings at one houre with the Beaſt. Theſe have one mind, and shal give their ſtrength and power to the Beaſt.</hi> Moreover, theſe are the hornes of the Beaſt, not of the Romane Empire divided, ver. 3. Which if they ſignify any diviſion, the Beaſt shalbe divided from his firſt ariſing. And further, ſeing they shall riſe <hi>at the ſame houre with the Beaſt,</hi> they shal not goe before him, whereby to declare by ſome praecurſion that he foloweth behind them. VVherfore nothing at al can be concluded from hence concerning the deſolation of the Romane Empire, as of any ſigne of Antichriſt coming.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The fourth place is out of 2. Theſ. 6.7. And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be reveled in his time, onely that he which now holdeth, may hold, til he be taken out of the way, and then shal the wicked man be reveled &amp;c. Where the Romane Empire,</hi> you ſay, <hi>hindreth Antichriſts coming, who shal take his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire out of the way, for their ſinns: and ſo doo the Greek and Latine Fathers expound this place.</hi> I anſwer, I doo acknowledge that the ancient Fathers (as I hav often ſayd,) did not level aright in theſe matters, for that being farr diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the event of things, they were led onely by coniectures. They knew ſo much as concerned their owne times. Yet remember, I pray you, what manner deſolation Ierom underſtandeth, who wil have <hi>him that did hold,</hi> to be taken out of the way, in his time; <hi>he that did hold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is taken out of the way</hi> &amp;c. as before I cited him. So that by his judgement, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire was then ſo deſolate, that ther was no let, on this behalfe, to hinder Antichriſts coming. And ſurely Gregorie ſayd not right, <hi>All things are doon that were foretold, the King of pride is nigh,</hi> if ſuch a deſolation had been to be looked for, as you ſpeak of; or ſuch ten Kings should goe before, as you Papiſts doo mention. Therfore thoſe Fathers were eyther altogither ignorant that ther was this let: or they ſo wavered to &amp; fro in a doubtful opinion, as no firme and ſtable thing can be gathered from their ſayings. But the Apocalyps being now very much illuſtrated by the event, putteth the matter out of controverſie, and explaineth Paul moſt certainly and faithfully, teaching that the <hi>withholder</hi> is not the <hi>Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pire,</hi> but the <hi>ſixt Romane King. Five</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are fallen; one</hi> namely the ſixt, <hi>is; the other is not yet come,</hi> chap. 17.10. that is, the Hethen Emperours, which make <hi>the ſixt King,</hi> doo now reign; which being at length removed, and delivering Rome empty to the Pope, the ſeventh King ſhal come, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichriſt. The Romane Empire is after a ſort one; but the manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring it by divers Magiſtrates, and the kinds of governing, was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold. Neither could it be ſaid, five Romane Empires are fallen, but five
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:6819:271"/> Kings, which were the Rulers and Moderators of that one Empire. More over Antichriſt is the ſeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th Romane King; for ſo the Angel plainly ſaith, <hi>and the Beaſt which was, and is not, and is the eight, and is one of the ſeven,</hi> verſe 11. Should the Romane Empire be deſolate, whiles the King therof was alive? nay verilie; but rather by bearing of him, the whore Rome ſhould greatly flouriſh. Therfore when Antichriſt cometh, the Romane Empire is not to be deſtroyed, but during that time fore-appointed of God, is marvelouſly to be conſerved, increaſed, amplifyed. We may underſtand therfore Paul and the Angel to ſpeake of the ſame impediment: but the Angel more plainly and clearly deſcribing it by place, dignity, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; by which moſt playn and true ſignes we might be led as by the hand, unto Antichriſts cradle. Wherfore Antichriſt should come, whiles the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane Empire is ſafe and flouriſhing: and ther was need that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should give place to the Pope, and leav his habitation free. You ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore Bellarmine, rely upon a manifeſt errour, wherby it wil come to paſſe, if in time you take not heed, that not expecting Antichriſt before the laſt overthrow of the Romane Kingdome, you wil be by him oppreſſed &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroyed, before you perceive that he is come.</p>
                        <p>Your ſecond propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, <hi>that the Romane Empire dooth yet endure,</hi> which I grant without contradiction, and now as you ſee, without any detrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the cauſe which I have in hand. Although in the head of this Empire, which I wil tel you in few words, you are ſurely much deceived. You think the Emperour hath this dignitie; and in deed I confeſſe, he hath it in name and title; but the Pope hath the thing it ſelfe. For the Romane King muſt be the head of the whore Rome, which the Emperour is not, but the Pope, who maketh the ſeventh &amp; eight head, as is declared Apoc. 17.11. Moreover the Emperours, ſince firſt the Beaſt began, have wholly ſerved him, as the Apocalyps alſo sheweth, ſaying, <hi>and they ſhal give their power &amp; their authoritie to the Beaſt;</hi> and the practiſe of al times, confirmeth it. Which ſervitude proceeded ſo farr, that they received a marke, and yeilded an oath of fealtie; that I ſpeake nothing of the other moſt unworthy wayes, wherby the Beaſt trode under foot the Emperial Maieſtie. Finally, the toes of the foot now divided, are holden togither by no common bond of the Emperours name, but onely of the whore of Rome. For what have Spayn, France, Venice, Florence, Naples, to doo with the Empire? Al theſe toes cleave togither in the common foundation of the Popes authority, which is the onely foot now, wherin theſe al agree and grow togither; and not the Empire, with which they have in a manner nothing to doo. Therfore the Emperours are in deed the <hi>Beaſts horns,</hi> but neither the <hi>leg</hi> of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:6819:271"/> Empire, nor the <hi>foot,</hi> but a <hi>toe of the foot,</hi> or the <hi>great toe</hi> perhaps whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſe the Pope. You Papiſts with certayn painted titles doo dazel their eyes; but they wil at length awake, and handle your Rome, according to their authoritie. The things which you diſpute for the Empire and Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rour, are vayn. <hi>Ther remaineth yet,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the ſucceſſion, and name of the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour of the Romanes: and by Gods marvelous providence, when the Empire fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the weſt, it remayned ſafe in the Eaſt: and when this fayled, it was erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn in the weſt.</hi> I anſwer; the ſucceſsion of the Empire remayneth not in the Emperour, but in the Pope. VVhen the <hi>ſixt</hi> head fel, the <hi>ſeventh</hi> ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to weet the Pope, and not the Chriſtian Emperours, who then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a horned dignitie; the ſucceſsion of which dignitie, and no other, they tranſferred to their poſteritie. They have the name of Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, but it is a title without ſubſtance: even as the Romane Church is caled Catholik, &amp; many ſuch like. But in refining the truth, we muſt look to the authority of the holy Ghoſt, not to the vayn words and voices of men. In deede Gods marvelous providence ſhined in conſidering this dignity, ſuch as it was, both in the Eaſt and VVeſt. But this providence is careful no leſſe for the <hi>horns</hi> then for the <hi>head:</hi> that is, aswel for theſe that are caled Emperours, as for the Pope. Both of them are by his decree, which appointed, that ſome of the toes of the foot, should be of yron. <hi>Neither dooth he hinder him,</hi> you ſay, <hi>from being Emperour, though he wanted Rome,</hi> which you prove by the example of <hi>Valens, Arcadius, Theodoſius the yonger, Charles the Great, and his ſucceſſours:</hi> then by the <hi>dignitie of going before al other Chriſtian Princes:</hi> moreover by <hi>the election of the Romanes:</hi> and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>by the Lutherans confeſſion.</hi> I anſwer to everie of theſe; and to the <hi>firſt,</hi> that if Valens, Arcadius, and Theodoſius the yonger, wanting Rome, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nevertheleſſe Romane Emperours; then the VVeſterne Empire fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not, neither doth the Eaſterne Empire fayl at this day, though the VVeſtern Emperours want Conſtantinople, if right be ynough without poſſeſsion. But the Kingdomes of this world are his that holdeth them: and although they be gotten for the moſt part by wickednes; yet God by his juſt judgement taketh from one, and giveth to another. Yet dooth not this his adminiſtration, quitt the robbers of crime: but he puniſhed in marvelous manner, both by abaſing one, and contrariweiſe advancing an other. It is therfore ſomwhat of more weight to want Rome, for this that any should be the Roman Emperour, than you ſpeake of.</p>
                        <p>Vnto the <hi>ſecond,</hi> namely that <hi>dignitie of going before al Chriſtian Princes,</hi> I confeſſe the Emperour goes before al the reſt: notwithſtanding, he that goes before al theſe, comes after the Pope, as none is ſo unskilful but
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:6819:272"/> ſeeth, in whom the Maieſtie of the Empire truly reſideth.</p>
                        <p>Vnto <hi>the third,</hi> be it that Charles the Great was created Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with conſent of the Romanes: yet the Apocalyps teacheth, that the Romane Empire is tied to the citie of Rome, not to the clamour of the Romane people.</p>
                        <p>Vnto the <hi>fourth,</hi> the Lutherans boaſting that they have three Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectours of the Romane Emperour, doo rather folow cuſtome of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, then the truth of the thing: or if in deede they ſo perſwade themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, it is through the common errour; the meaning of the Apocalypſe, not being by them as yet ynough perceived. Wherfore you gull the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours with a deceitful title, who whiles the Romane Pope poſſeſſeth Rome, neither truly are nor shalbe Romane Emperours: and thus you contending that the Romane Empire dooth yet indure, have not found in what place it is, whoſe both head and habitation you are ignorant of. From this reſtored Empire by the Pope, doo Luther, Illyricus, and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treus rightly gather, that he is that great Antichriſt. Yet not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Charles the Great was declared Empetour by him, as for that the Empire did revive in the Pope, who being a Bishop in name, was made Emperour in deede. This is evident by this, that the Beaſt hath a <hi>head</hi> both <hi>wounded</hi> &amp; <hi>healed;</hi> for both theſe perteyn to the ſame Beaſt. Alſo, the <hi>Beaſt which was not</hi> whiles the Barbarians prevayled, is that verie ſame <hi>which is</hi> when they are extinguished. Moreover Antichriſt is both the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth King</hi> from Conſtantine, unto the Kingdome of the Gothes; &amp; the <hi>eight</hi> by a new riſing up after the healed head by Iuſtinian, and Phocas, &amp; the reſt folowing, as is explayned Apoc. 13.3.11. and 17.10.11. You anſwer, that <hi>the healed head, is not the Romane Emperour, but Antichriſt, who feighneth himſelfe dead, and by diveliſh art, ſhal riſe himſelfe up againe: and that ſo almoſt al the ancient Fathers doo expound it.</hi> Vnto this, I ſay, that you doo not rightly disjoyne the Romane Emperour, and Antichriſt: which two, if we would ſpeake properly according to the Apocalyps, doo make one and the ſame perſon. Not that he which at this day is caled Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is Antichriſt: but becauſe whatſoever is in this name Emperour, it naturally belongeth to the Pope. For both <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Romane Emperour,</hi> or <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> were wounded to death by the invaſion of the Goths. For the ſeventh head which then ſeemed to perish, was both a <hi>hill</hi> and a <hi>King;</hi> that is, <hi>Rome</hi> or the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> Apoc. 17.9. It is true therfore which you ſay, that <hi>the text it ſelfe playnly compelleth us, by that head of the Beaſt, which was dead and revived, to underſtand not Charles the Great, but Antichriſt.</hi> For Charles the Great, was not Emperour indeede: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:6819:272"/> he did not dye and live agayne, yet the Romane Emperour or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the Pope, did die and live agayn, as is ſufficiently ſaid before. By which alſo may appear, that that which is commonly ſpoken of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts feighned death and reſurrection, is a playn fiction: a feighned death is in ſport and voluntary; but Antichriſt dyed this death againſt his wil, and with ſore payn; from which death when he began to come forth, very great was the torment of his freſh wound, as witneſſeth Gregorie the Great, by his many mournful lamentations.</p>

                        <head>Chapt. 6. Against the third Demonstration, from the coming of Henoch and Elias.</head>
                        <p>HITHERTO of the ſignes going before: now of them that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him: and firſt of the coming of <hi>Henoch and Elias, who are yet,</hi> you ſay, <hi>alive; and doo live for this, that they may ſet themſelves againſt Antichriſt when he cometh, and keepe the elect in the faith of Chriſt, and at length convert the Jewes: which notwithſtanding it is certain is not yet fulfilled.</hi> In this cauſe you deal by three arguments, firſt from the Scriptures; ſecondly from Fathers thirdly from reaſon. The ſcriptures you bring are four, Malach. 4.5.6. Eccleſiaſticus 48.9.10. and chap. 44.16. Mat. 17.11. Apoc. 17.11. As touching Malachy, his words are; <hi>Behold I wil ſend you Elias the Prophet, before that great day of the Lord ſhal come, and he ſhal turne the harts of the Fathers unto the children, and the harts of the children unto their Fathers, which cannot,</hi> you ſay, <hi>be underſtood of anie Doctors whoſoever, as of Luther, Zwinglius, &amp; the like. For Malachie ſayth that the Jewes ſhalbe converted by Elias, and for the Jewes he ſhal chiefly be ſent, as appeareth by thoſe words,</hi> I wil ſend to you, <hi>and in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiaſticus, to reſtore the Tribes of Jakob: but Luther and Zwinglius, converted none of the Jewes. And neither can they be underſtood of Iohn Babptiſt literally, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Elias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer, firſt, here is no word of <hi>Henoch,</hi> whoſe conioyned coming was propounded alſo. Secondly, no mention neither is here of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> but that he ſhal come togither with him, that wholly dependeth on a falſe ſuppoſition, of which we wil ſpeake in due place. This therfore is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Demonſtration, that propounding to it ſelf the coming of three, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither ſilent of two of them. But let us diſcuſſe him whom it ſpeaketh of. The Propheſie, you ſay, can not be underſtood of Luther, and Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius and the other Miniſters of the Gentiles Church: which I alſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge. For I doo not thinke it to perteyn unto us which are Gentiles.</p>
                        <pb n="530" facs="tcp:6819:273"/>
                        <p>But why may it not be expounded of the Iewes? <hi>becauſe it agrees not,</hi> you ſay, <hi>unto Iohn the Baptiſt:</hi> which is as if you should ſay, eyther it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounded of the Baptiſt, or of none: which maymed and unneceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, no adverſarie can grant unto you. But to pardon you alſo this third treſpaſſe, why perteyns it not, I pray you, unto the Baptiſt? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Malachie ſpeaketh of our Lords ſecond coming, which ſhalbe for to iudge.</hi> I anſwer; if we granted that he ſpeaks of the ſecond coming, may he not withall ſpeake alſo of the firſt? Moſt certayn verily it is, that Malachie dooth ſo: for he ſpeaks generally of the Lords coming; which comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as wel the firſt, as the ſecond. And wheras your ſelfe confeſſe it of the ſecond, neyther doo I deny it: of the firſt we have Chriſt interpreting the words of the Propheſie, where he ſpeaketh of the Baptiſt, <hi>this is Elias that ſhould come,</hi> Mat. 11.14. Seing therfore the words are ſo; behold now, how I fetch from hence a true interpretation, againſt that literal of Elias. He that ſpeaketh in the ſame words, of two times: he as he is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the one time, ſo is he to be underſtood of the other: But Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy ſpeaketh of a twofold coming of the Lord; and of the firſt, he is to be underſtood figuratively, for ſo Chriſt interpreteth it, ſaying, that the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt is the Elias that was to come.</hi> Therfore he is to be underſtood alſo figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of the ſecond; and ſuch an Elias is to be looked for, as the Baptiſt was before the firſt coming. But whither he shalbe one ſingular man or no, is not ſo evident: it may be ther shalbe one chief, and excelling amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the reſt; although the whole company of Prophets, when it shal pleaſe God, to gather his reiected people, shalbe ſo furnished with the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gifts of his Spirit, that for the notable godlines and zele wherwith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them shalbe inflamed, Elias may wel ſeem to be alive agayn in eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry one. For theſe abiding watchmen on the walls of the Citie Ieruſalem, al the day and al the night continually shal not hold their peace; neither shal they that make mention of Iehovah, keepe ſilence, nor ſuffer ſilence to be of him, as ſaith Eſaias, chap. 62, 8.9. Surely theſe new preachers of the Goſpel, shal burn with ſo great a deſire of godlines, that as conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves wholly to the glory of God, and ſalvation of his people, they wil doo this one thing onely, nothing at al eſteeming in reſpect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even the neceſſarie regard of their body, by ſleep and reſt. And what a fervencie shal ther be in the Miniſters, when among the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a father &amp; mother which hav begotten a ſon, shal ſtrike him through when he is found a falſe Prophet? Zach. 13.2.3. But whither this <hi>Elias</hi> shalbe one ſingular man, or more, he shal not be Elias properly, but ſo as the Baptiſt was, as we are taught by this neceſſarie reaſon which I have
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:6819:273"/> alleged. But you inſiſt and contend <hi>that this coming in Malachie, is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d onely,</hi> (although the interpretation of our Lord ought to have ſtoped your mouth:) <hi>for ſo,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Malachie ſaith, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. For his firſt coming is not caled a great and terrible day; but an accepta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble time, and day of ſalvation. Wherupon alſo ther is added, leaſt coming J ſmite the earth with curſing. But in his firſt coming our Lord came not to judge, but to be iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, nor to deſtroy, but to ſave.</hi> I anſwer; you have brought nothing, which neceſſarily proveth it the ſecond coming onely: the ſame things which you mention, the Iewes and Diſciples knew alſo, who nevertheleſſe did then look for Elias, before our Lords riſing from the dead. And hereunto perteyneth that queſtion, when the Lord had made mention of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Why then ſay the Scribes that Elias muſt firſt come?</hi> Mat. 17.9. And as for the <hi>great and terrible day,</hi> why doth it not agree unto his firſt coming? <hi>Loe</hi> ſaith Malachy, <hi>the Lord ſhal come ſpeedily into his Temple. And who ſhal abide the day of his coming? and who ſhal endure when he appeareth? for he is like a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fyre, and like fullers ſope,</hi> Malach. 3.1.2. &amp;c. And theſe things are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his firſt coming. And is not that day terrible, wherin the axe is laid to the roote of the trees, and they that are unfruitful are cutt down, and caſt into the fyre? How fearful is it, to have among them, him whoſe fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n is in his hand, who wil purge his floor, &amp; gather his wheat into the barn, and burn the chaff with unquenchable fyre? Mat. 3.10.12. But <hi>he came not to iudge, but to be iudged?</hi> He came not indeed to iudge ſolemnly in a tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bunal ſeat, as he shal doo at length in the laſt iudgment: yet in the meane while, the father hath given al iudgement to him, Iohn 5.22. which he both exerciſed of old, and dayly now exerciſeth upon al contemners of the truth, as we may ſee in the Iewes, that crucifyed him: upon whom e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this day abideth the longeſt and heavieſt puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al that ever were ſince the firſt mans fal, as it were a viſible document of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hell. This time of grace is acceptable to the elect; but to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving and diſobedient, ther is none more hurtful, whom the Son of God punisheth daily with blindnes of mind, and hardnes of hart, untill they have heaped up to themſelves the iuſt meaſure of wrath, in their laſt and never ending perdition, Heb. 10.28.29. Vherfore nothing hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, why the Prophets words may not be underſtood, both of the firſt coming, and of the ſecond: wherby that literal Elias faleth, whom you would gather from the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond place is out of Eccleſiaſticus, chap. 44.16. <hi>Henoch pleaſed God, and was taken away; an example of repentance to the generations.</hi> And cha. 48.9.10. <hi>which waſt taken up in a whirlewind of fyre, in a charret of fyrie horſes,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:6819:274"/> which waſt appointed for reproofs in times, that thou mighteſt pacifie wrath before rage, and mighteſt turn the harts of the Fathers unto the children, and ſet up the tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bes of Iakob.</hi> I anſwer, it was not to be expected of the Demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtratour; that he should bring thoſe witneſſes, whom they againſt whom he uſeth them account not of ſufficient credit. But I wil not lay this blame upon you too ſeverely, ſeing the words conteyn nothing contrarie to the Scriptures. <hi>But</hi> ſay you, <hi>they agree not, ſave to thoſe particular perſons.</hi> In deed Henoch was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away after a particular manner; but I doo not find the leaſt ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his return. For as concerning that <hi>example of repentance to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> he is made this by his going away, not by coming agayn. His ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away cryeth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, &amp; shal cry unto the end, how great good things doo in deede abide for them that repent.</p>
                        <p>It was alſo peculiar unto Elias, to be taken away in a fyrie whirlewind: but to <hi>turne the harts of the Fathers unto the children,</hi> dooth not ſo agree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but it migh, as our Lord alſo taught, be applyed unto the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; and afterwards unto the like Eliaes, that should come in the laſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, ſuch as the Baptiſt was. Wherfore here is no one ſyllable, nor the leaſt title of his returne in his owne perſon. Which <hi>Janſon;</hi> one of your owne men, ſaw; at whom you marvel, that one of your ſelves durſt utter anie thing ſincerely. A rare liberty in deed it is among you, who are wont not to ſerch the truth out of the Scriptures, ſo much as the maintenance of your errour.</p>
                        <p>The third Scripture is from Mat. 17.11. <hi>Elias in deede ſhall come, and ſhall reſtore all things. Therfore,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the true Elias, not John: who was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come, and could not be ſaid that he was to come.</hi> I anſwer, The Diſciples in the former verſe, had made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of Elias to come; whoſe ſpeech Chriſt taking, ſo ſpeaketh as if he should ſay; true in deed it is which you ſay, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias is to come. Are we wont to ſpeak otherweiſe, ſo oft as we relate the ſpeech of others concerning one to come? Further, let us ſuppoſe, that Chriſt ſpeaketh of ſome one to come; yet ſhal not he be anie other Elias then <hi>Iohn</hi> was; as the reaſon before rendred, dooth ſufficiently convince. But you would prove it by two arguments: Firſt, that the Diſciples mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the queſtion by occaſion of the transfiguration, did ſpeak <hi>of the true Elias: and therfore Chriſt anſwering, did ſpeak of the ſame particular Elias,</hi> I anſwer it may be, that the Apoſtles were not yet free from the Iewes common er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour about Elias: notwithſtanding it is not neceſſarie that the anſwer should alwayes be made according to the mind of him that asketh the queſtion. Which is manifeſt even in this place, when after it is ſaid, the Diſciples underſtood, that he ſpake theſe things unto them of Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt;
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:6819:274"/> ver. 13. How underſtood they it of Iohn; if our Lord did ſpeake of the true Elias? The ſecond argument is from thoſe words, <hi>and ſhal reſtore all things: that,</hi> ſay you, <hi>John did not. For to reſtore al things, is to cal againe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true faith, al Jewes, and Heretiks, and perhaps manie Catholiks deceived by Antichriſt.</hi> I anſwer, except this reſtoring of al things did in deed after a ſort belong unto Iohn: the Diſciples which ſaw no ſuch reſtoring, did miſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>underſtand our Lord to ſpeak of Iohn. But a great reſtoring did he make, <hi>from whoſe dayes hitherto,</hi> ſayth the Lord. <hi>the Kingdome of heaven ſuffreth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> Mat. 11.12. unto whoſe Baptiſme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted both <hi>al Jeruſalem, and al Judaea, and al the region round about Jordan, and many of the Phariſees and Sadducees;</hi> as Mat. 3.5.7. Although I wil not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but ther ſhal be yet a more ful reſtoring, and that of al things proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that al Iſrael may be ſaved, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, of which, that reſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring by Iohn, was as it were a shadow. But it is not neceſſary, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſter of this reſtoring, should be the true Elias; but one ſo caled by a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litude, as is ſaid upon the place of Malachie. And this Elias what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of one ſo ever he shal be, shal not accompany Antichriſt, but folow after him: and shal not shew himſelfe, before Antichriſt be aboliſhed, or his kingdom at leaſt be very much darkned; as this Apocalyps maketh plain. Wherfore we find no fooſtep in theſe words, of the true Elias properly ſo caled: much leſſe in thoſe, <hi>and if you wil receive it, this is Elias which was to come,</hi> Mat. 11.14. Wher even againſt your wil, you acknowledge that Iohn was the promiſed Elias, not literally, but allegorically. Which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, and that now by your owne confeſsion, we have our Lord him ſelfe interpreting thoſe words of Malachy allegorically: ſhew you I pray you, by what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent author, they are to be underſtood literally: which until you doo, we wil reſt in that one allegorical expoſition, unto which we dare add no other, without ſome guide, againſt whom no exception can be taken.</p>
                        <p>The fourth Scripture is Apocalyps Chapter 11. verſe 13. <hi>And I will give to my two Prophets, and they ſhall Propheſie one thouſand two hundred three ſcore dayes. Which are to he underſtood,</hi> you ſay, <hi>of the ſingular perſons of Henoch and Elias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But in ſted of anſwer, I aske of you, whither alſo <hi>fire</hi> ſhal come out of their mouthes properly, which ſhal devoure their enemies? For ſo it is there ſayd, in the fift verſe of the chapter: and ther ſeemeth to be the ſame conſideration of this fyre, and of their perſons. Which if it be ſo, then Woe to ANTICHRIST, for whom ſuch companions are appointed and prepared.</p>
                        <pb n="534" facs="tcp:6819:275"/>
                        <p>One may wel marvel, how he ſhal fulfil the three yeeres and a half of his reign, and not rather be conſumed the very firſt day, by this devouring fyre. But if theſe things doo not ſatiſfy you, I have shewed upon that place, that the words can in no weiſe be underſtood of their ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; wherof I wil yet give you now a more full confirmation. Theſe two Prophets doo come into the world, clothed in ſackcloth, ſtraightway af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Hethen Emperours: for theſe are clad with ſackcloth, and the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is meſured, both at a time. The meſured Temple, is the womans ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the wildernes, wherunto ſhe fled, at the riſing up of the Beaſt. The Beaſt the ſeventh Roman King, ſuccedeth next unto the ſixt, to weet that which reigned in Iohns time. Therfore when the Beaſt ſprung up ſtraight way after the Hethen Emperours, theſe ſackcloth-Prophets began their mornful office: and therfore they are not properly Henoch and Elias. Now ſee, if ther be any thing fooliſher then your dotage of theſe two to come in their owne perſons: your dotage, I ſay, for the ancient holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might miſse and be deceived; but you continuing in open errour, I ſee not what it differeth from madnes. But let us goe on to the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                        <p>You prove that the Apocalyps ſpeaketh properly of Henoch &amp; Elias, <hi>becauſe it is ſayd, they ſhould be killed of Antichriſt, and their bodies remayn three dayes in buried in the ſtreet of the great Citie: and that after three dayes they ſhould riſe agayn, and aſcend into heaven: which things,</hi> you ſay, <hi>have never as yet happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto any.</hi> I anſwer, that I have made it playn, by the order of the time, and agreement of al things; that al theſe things are already performed; namely, when the Fathers of Trent, killed the Holy Scriptures, ſpoiling them of al authority, and tying the meaning of them unto the Pope. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which Iohn ſaith of the death of theſe Prophets, affordeth a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry argument againſt this literal ſenſe of thoſe ſingular perſons. For He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch shal not dye otherweiſe then of old by his taking away; the Apoſtle ſaying, <hi>by faith Henoch was taken away that he ſhould not ſee death, and he was not found, becauſe God tooke him away: for before his taking away he had teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that he had pleaſed God,</hi> Heb. 11.5. The like reaſon ther is alſo of Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as. For God is alwaies like himſelfe, and giveth like things to like perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for like ends. Therfore they are not to be killed by Antichriſt. But Tertul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lian, you ſay, in his book <hi>De anima,</hi> chap. 28. ſaith, <hi>Henoch and Elias were taken away, neither is their death found, for it was deferred: but they are reſerved for to dye, that by their blood, they maie extinguiſh Antichriſt.</hi> I anſwer, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian hath nothing ſave a geſſe, that theſe whom the Apocalyps mentioned, are Henoch and Elias: but the Apoſtle evidently &amp; plainly teacheth that
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:6819:275"/> 
                           <hi>Henoch was taken away that he ſhould not ſee death.</hi> Now the choiſe is eaſy. whom we should rather beleev. It becomes not holy men, to avouch their blind opinions, againſt the open words of the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto hath been your <hi>firſt</hi> argument. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is from the conſent of the Fathers; unto all whom I oppoſe the conſent of the Scriptures, which had indeede been ynough for them, if through darknes of the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes they could have perceived them. Ther is no need therfore to tary lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in examining their opinions, which they themſelves, if they were now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, would with their owne voices condemn.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, you prove it, <hi>becauſe otherweiſe ther can no reaſon be rendred, why theſe two were taken away before death, and doo yet live in mortal fleſh, being one day for to dye.</hi> I anſwer, that theſe laſt words, <hi>being one day for to daye,</hi> doo contradict the Apoſtle, as we shewed even now: and then, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the words next before, of falſhood. For if Henoch be not for to dye, it cannot be that he dooth yet live in a mortal body. For that is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, which is not for to dye. But whither they yet live in the fleſh or no, is not ſo manifeſt, nor indeed neceſſarie to be known. If it be lawful ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inquire about this thing, they ſeem to be exempted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon death of men, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Henoch, <hi>that he should not ſee death;</hi> and not to live as yet in their bodies. For they live not on earth. For ſeing they are adorned of God, with more excellent good than the reſt: they cannot be inferiour unto other ſoules, in this thing. And the ſoules in heaven, have greater ioy and more ample felicitie than can be on earth. Neither could they togither with their bodies enter into heaven; the Apoſtle avouching that <hi>flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor corruption inherit the nature uncorrupt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50. But againſt this may be obiected, that they had the ſame change, that thoſe which are aliv ſhal have at the coming of the Lord, according to that which is written, <hi>wee shal not al dye, but we shall al be changed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.51. I grant that ther might have been this change, (though this would no way furder your cauſe,) if that ſaying of the Apoſtle hindred not, <hi>And theſe al through faith, obteyned goo report, and received not the promiſe, God providing a better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfit,</hi> Heb. 11.39, 40. For if they felt that change, how obteyned they not the promiſe, to weet glorification: which is the felicity of the ſoule ioyned togither with the body immortall? And if they obteyned the promiſe <hi>without us,</hi> that is, before us: what cauſe can ther be why alſo <hi>without us</hi> they are not made perfit? Theſe two things ſeem openly to be repugnant unto the Apoſtle. Thoſe two therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cutt off, namely their death to come, and their preſent mortal body,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:6819:276"/> both which are manifeſtly falſe: and that being let paſſe which is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, whither they be at al as yet in their bodies: if now you think ther is no other reaſon why theſe two were taken away before their death, ſave that they might come againe to fight with Antichriſt; you are willingly blind. The Apoſtle ſaith, that Henoch was taken away, <hi>becauſe he pleaſeth God, walking continually with him:</hi> Eccluſ. 44. <hi>that he might be an exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of repentance,</hi> that is, that he might ſtirr up men uto repentance, which look and think upon this notable example of Gods ſingular lov towards his. And doo you think it a light matter, that ther should be unto all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the world a moſt clear document of the immortality of the body, and of the aſcenſion therof at laſt into heaven? Before the Law and the floud, Henochs aſcenſion confirmed this faith to the men of that age. For unto men at leaſt weiſe he aſcended, <hi>for he was not found,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſayth, Heb. 11.5. Vnder the Law, Elias aſcended; of whom ther is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me reaſon. After the Law, Ieſus Chriſt, the firſt fruits of al that aſcend: by whoſe merit &amp; power, both thoſe former, in what manner ſoever it was, did aſcend, and al the elect shal at length aſcend. Onely Antichriſt did ſo ſtick in your eyes, that you could ſee none of theſe things, or any ſuch like. But deceive your ſelf no longer, with vayn exſpectation of Henoch and Elias: looſe not your labour with the men of Iericho, ſeeking their bodies upon the earth; what ſay I? your labour? yea a greater loſſe han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth over your head, namely, be not you found in the number of them, that <hi>folowing the Beaſt, have not their names written in the book of life.</hi> Ap. 17.8.</p>

Dei,</hi> ch. 8. &amp; 9. of <hi>Hippolitus martyr, &amp; of Cyril:</hi> unto which you add at laſt, that <hi>the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the Pope is not the moſt greevous, &amp; therfore he is not Antichriſt.</hi> I anſwer to al, &amp; firſt as touching the greevouſnes of the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the words of Mat. I ſay, that you care not what you bring for confirmation. Thoſe words perteyn to the calamity of the Iewes, which they felt in the
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:6819:276"/> deſolation of their city by Titus, within a few yeres after Chriſt. Luke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth this people by name, ſaying, <hi>for ther ſhalbe great diſtreſſe in this land, &amp; wrath on this people,</hi> Luke 21.23. So Mat. <hi>then let them that ar in Judea, flee to the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayns,</hi> ch. 24.16. And what ells meaneth that prayer againſt flight <hi>on the Sabath,</hi> but properly to note out this nation? So farr verily is it, that Antichriſts perſecution is from theſe words proved to be <hi>moſt greevous,</hi> as the contrary may plainly be concluded: for they evidently doo confirm, that <hi>no tribulation ſhalbe to be compared wit that of the Jewes;</hi> &amp; therefore, not that which Antichriſt shal procure. I know that Chryſoſtome referrs it ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pically unto Antichriſt, but not truly, nor adviſedlie: for when Chriſt ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, <hi>none shal be like it,</hi> he cutteth off al typical interpretation: not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely forbidding the words to be further drawn for to ſignify any thing to come. For the type muſt needs be inferiour to the truth of it, &amp; a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtreſſe muſt folow afterwards, contrary to that Chriſt ſaith, if ſo be the words should be expounded by a type. Mathew therfore makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the vehemency of this perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; the Apocalyps dooth even as much. Satan in deed shal rage when he is looſed, but the outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which is mentioned in that place, is nothing to that which he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before he was bound. For Satan is the ſame that the Dragon, Apoc. 12 9. and before his impriſonment, he lived <hi>in heaven, drawing with his tayl the third part of the ſtarrs of heaven; which he caſt unto the earth,</hi> until by Michael he was overcome, and thrown down from thence. That is to ſay; the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperours, not only lived, but alſo ruled in the midds of the Church, which they vexed in moſt cruel ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, til Chriſt put them out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; as upon that place I have shewed. From that time the Divil that is the open enemie, was bound for a thouſand yeres: which being fulfilled, his bounds should be looſed, &amp; he should be ſtyrrd up agayn, but not with that abilitie to hurt, as before; for here he should have no place in <hi>heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, in the Church, but should abide only in the utmoſt borders &amp; territories therof, <hi>compaſſing the tents of the Saincts, &amp; the beloved city,</hi> as Ap 20.9. wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should not ſo much raiſe perſecution as warr; neither should the ſaincts dye lik sheep, but reſiſt lik ſoljers. How much therfore an inward &amp; noiſom enemie is mor greevous than an outward; ſo much greater is the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the former times, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that when Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is looſed, in the laſt age. Morover Antich. reigneth a 1000 yeres, whiles Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyeth in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ap. 20.9. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is looſed, this felow doo trobel al: ther should be great tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quility whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; ſo the greateſt part at leaſt of his reign, sh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ould be void of thoſe turbule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtorms, neirher should Antich. hav an helper of his perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other part of his reign: ſeing he should abid within the Church &amp; Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without as is manifeſt by the things foreſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: alſo that now he was appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted for the ſcourge of Antic. himſelf, not for their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; torturer, whom he should uſe for the tormenting of others.</p>
                        <pb n="538" facs="tcp:6819:277"/>
                        <p>For the Divil being now looſed, the <hi>four Angels at Euphrates are looſed,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſendeth to punish the <hi>Angel of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> with his infernall crew, which came out of the pit, Apoc. 9.20.21. all which things we hav made playn in their places. Therfore wher Auguſtine ſaith, that Antichr. shal moſt rage when the Divil is looſed; as though he were now firſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and should be his helper unto crueltie; he iudgeth not rightly of this looſing: for he was looſed before in heaven, Apoc. 12.3. &amp;c. which could not be a priſon and pit unto him, ſeing he took it heavilie to be caſt from thence: unleſſe perhaps he went out of priſon againſt his wil, Apoc. 12.10. Neither is <hi>Hippolitus</hi> to be hearkened unto concerning this perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he teacheth that <hi>Antichriſt is no man, but the verie Divil, that should take falſe flesh of a falſe virgin.</hi> And no better account is to be made of <hi>Cyrill,</hi> if he though that the Divil should perſonally range abroad, making Antichriſt to be a true man, but one that should be a Divil alſo, becauſe as he thinks, he should be made man by incarnation. What ſincere thing could they utter about this matter, whoſe minds were poſſeſſed by ſuch manner errours? Wherfore this grievouſnes of perſecution which you ſpeak of, hath no confirmation at al from the Scriptures. A very gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous perſecution in deed ther should be but of an other ſort then you me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion; even ſuch as should conſiſt not ſo much in killing of bodies, as in murthering of ſoules. For Antichriſt is <hi>Balaam,</hi> who though it better to put a ſtumbling block before the children of Iſrael, that they migh eate of things ſacrificed to Idols, and committ fornication, then to folow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſword, Apoc. 2.14. He is that <hi>Beaſt,</hi> wheron Iezebel the whore ſitteth, <hi>with the wine of whoſe fornication, the inhabitants of the earth are drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Apoc. 2.20. &amp; 17.2. He is the <hi>Angel of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> who ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the pit, the Sun and aier is darkned with the ſmoke, Apoc. 9.2. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally he is that <hi>man of ſyn,</hi> whoſe coming is with the efficacie of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with al power and ſignes and lying wonders, and with al deceit of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in them that perish, for that they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved. Therfore God ſendeth them the efficacie of de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceit, that they may beleev a lye: that they al may be damned, which have not beleeved the truth, but taken pleaſure in unrighteouſnes. 2 Theſ. 2.9.10. Behold the true perſecution of Antichriſt, being rather pernicious to the ſoules than to the bodies: although he should not refreyn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wickednes of shedding bloud; for he should alſo cauſe that <hi>whoſoever would not worship the Image of the Beaſt, should be killed,</hi> Apoc. 13.15. And he is that <hi>skarlet Beaſt</hi> of bloudy colour, gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the bloud of the ſaincts, ſpringled on him. But that ſpiritual perſecution is the more outragious,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:6819:277"/> by ſo much as the ſowl is better than the body, and as the conioynt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction of both, is crueller than the perdition of one. Wheras before you ſay that <hi>ther is no compariſon of the Popes perſecution of us,</hi> whom you cal <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, with the perſecution of Nero, Domitian, Decius, Diocleſian and others,</hi> as if from hence it were certayn that the Pope is not Antichriſt; now every ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſee, that it is nothing to the purpoſe. For Antichriſts cruelty, is not to be meaſured by the privation of mortal life, but by the loſſe of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. And this is that which ſurpaſſeth al priſons, ſwords, wild beaſts, fyres, burning yrons, molten lead, or any exquiſite torment that either Nero, or any other of the tyrants exerciſed. This is that, for the torment wherof, men <hi>ſought death, but found it not, and deſired to dye: but death fled from them;</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely becauſe they felt payn sharper than death, Apoc. 9.6. This is that for which ſtraightway at the riſing up of the Beaſt, <hi>the woman fled into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which could not be put to flight by anie gibbets or flames, wherwith the Emperours raged, Apoc. 12.6. &amp;c. VVherfore though we should grant, that a greater ſlaughter of bodies was made by Nero and ſuch like tyrants: yet nothing letteth, but the cruelty of the Bishop of Rome may ſurpaſſe in an other reſpect, and be ſuch, as wherby he may manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the great Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>many moe of the Catholiks have our Heretiks killed, theſe 10 or 15-yeres, in France and Flanders; then the Inquiſitours have burned of the Heretiks, perhaps in one hundred yeres. And if it may be caled perſecution, the Catholiks doo rather ſuffer it, than the Lutherans or Calviniſts. For the Catholiks ar they which being driven out of manie countries, have loſt Churches, patrimonies, and countrie it ſelfe, the new Miniſters of the Goſpel invading them.</hi> I anſwer: wheras now you ar reſiſted, &amp; ſome of you whiles they oppugne the good eſtate of others, have loſt their own: that nothing hindereth the ſpiritual perſecution of your Pope. He rageth yet with no leſſe deadly feud againſt the truth, than at anie time before; yea with greater, if greater may be. But this ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his men, ſomewhat mitigateth the corporal perſecution. But the Spirit hath foretold, that that ſhalbe brought at laſt upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your own heads, which you were wont to doo unto others. For Chriſt threatned that <hi>he would ſlay Iezabels children with death,</hi> Apoc. 2.23. and <hi>that they ſhould goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivitie, which doo lead into captivitie, and be killed with the ſowrd, which doo kill with the ſword,</hi> Apoc. 13.10. Finally, <hi>that the rivers and fountains of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be turned into bloud, and that they ſhould drink bloud, which did ſhed the bloud of the Saincts and Prophets,</hi> Apoc. 16.4.5.6. Neither is this divine recompenſe to be caled a <hi>perſecution,</hi> unleſſe perhaps it be perſecution to repell force by force; or to take from theevs &amp; robbers, the goods, which
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:6819:278"/> they have ſtollen from the right owners, or to drive out of the countrie, them that betray the country, or to drive away the wolves from the folds. Your wickednes is now known unto al, your treaſons, murders, poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, cut-throat boldnes, ſubtil plottings againſt Princes, unto which you apply your ſelves with al diligence, and often accompliſh them with overmuch. Theſe things cauſe many of you to looſe your heads, theſe be the merits of your Martyrs, theſe be the crowns, theſe be trophees or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes of your victories. It is to be wiſhed of al which love the publik peace and ſafetie, that by the faithful diligence and vigilancy of the Magiſtrates, this perſecution may more increaſe dayly. And thus much of the <hi>greevouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the perſecution:</hi> which howſoever it be great in deed, yet you ſee it is an other, than you ſuppoſed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you prove that <hi>Antichriſts perſecution ſhalbe moſt notorious and manifeſt,</hi> from thoſe words Apoc. 20.8. <hi>and they compaſſed the tents of the Saincts, and the beloved citie. And that the Popes perſecution is ſuch, as neither they which ſay they ſuffer it, nor you which are ſaid to inferr it, can ſay when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gann.</hi> I anſwer; thoſe words of the Apocalyps perteyn nothing unto anie vexation that shalbe inferred by Antichriſt, but by <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog.</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was ſlayn &amp; caſt into the lake of fyre, in the end of the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; wherupon he hath no part in this battel, neither shal the laſt afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be rayſed by him, as you falſly doo often avouch, but by an other that ſhal for a while ſurvive Antichriſt. And that you may underſtand how An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts perſecution, shal not be moſt notorious in the doing of it: you muſt remember that Antichriſts propertie is to invade with all guile and fraud, not with open and diſplayed flaggs. Therfore that he shal cary his matters with verie great ſilence, and privily, which be arts fitteſt for ſecret ambuſh, not that he should be eſpied of al. Moreover, when <hi>al the earth ſhould worſhip the Beaſt,</hi> needs muſt the affliction be of the leſſer part, and ſo not moſt notorious, Apoc. 13.3. That which is doon by the moſt, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly counted to be doon by right; and to deſerv no reprehenſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, his perſecution is ſpecially ſpiritual, which eaſily deceiveth the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie ſenſe and eyes: wherupon though it should not be ſo readily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eyther when Antichriſt shal come, or unto whom he shal firſt appear, or when his perſecution shal begin: yet this maketh the thing it ſelfe no more doubtful and ambiguous, than it is uncertayn that the plague is the plague, becauſe it is not evident unto al, from whence it firſt proceeded; or that a fyre conſumeth &amp; devoureth al things, becauſe it is not found out, how firſt it began and grew. But howſoever theſe things have heretofore perhaps been more obſcure: ſee now how much we have profited by this
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:6819:278"/> Apocalyps, by help wherof we ar come neerer unto that beginning which you ſeek. For from hence we learne, that ſtraightway after the Emperours were for doon, <hi>the woman fled into the wildernes, &amp; a burning mountayn was caſt into the Sea,</hi> chap. 8. For then the barrs being burſt, the Roman ambition could no longer be held in: then began errour and ſuperſtition of everie ſort, ſpeedily to enter: then was inſtituted the Feaſt of the Inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of the Croſſe; and Confirmation made a new Sacrament, and that greater, as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Melchiades would have it, than Baptiſm. Then al the neighbours in their order, ſtrove who might moſt heap up new adulterate rites: until at length it came to the opening of the <hi>Bottmleſſe pitt,</hi> at what time the whole infernal darknes broke out. Neither yet was this an end of the calamitie, but at laſt, by the Trident Council, <hi>the two Prophets were ſlayn,</hi> the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res being killed, and their bare carkeſſes caſt out, as we have shewed, cha. 11.9. wherupon ſoon alſo it came to paſſe, that by the Ieſuits, the Maſters of controverſies, <hi>the whole Sea of Popiſh doctrine, was turned into abominable &amp; deadly putrifyed bloud,</hi> chap. 16.3. This is the upriſing and proceeding of your ſpiritual perſecution. The corporal alſo cannot now be hidd from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: which beginning after the ſecond upriſing of the Beaſt, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>Leo Iſauricus;</hi> depoſed King <hi>Childericus;</hi> warre with the <hi>Emperours;</hi> put ſome of them from their Empire; fell with noyſome ſignes upon the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes,</hi> and almoſt quite deſtroyed them; would not helpe the <hi>Greeks</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turks, unleſſe they would firſt ſubject themſelves to the Latin Pope; did break <hi>Europe</hi> with continual warrs, by ſetting the Princes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ears; burned <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Jerom of Prage:</hi> armed <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. againſt the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> conſumed manie Chriſtians in France with flames, shewed the ſame crueltie upon manie in England: made that memorable maſſacre in Paris: ſet up the tormenting boucherie of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie of his dominions: finally, which ſent the <hi>Spaniſh Navie</hi> into England: invaded <hi>Jreland</hi> by force of armes: expoſed the Realm of our gracious Queen, to the ſpoile of any whomſoever: and deſtinated her ſacred perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto death; her people, to the prey; and the whole nation to moſt cruel ſlaughter. Theſe things are now known, and wil ere long be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: but while the matters were a doing, they were dect and covered with ſo fayr a shew of piety &amp; zele for the houſe of God, that the injurie which was doon unto anie, ſeemed not ſo much to be hatred and perſecution, as eyther the juſt defenſe of the Church, or puniſhment of the wicked. This publik knowledge therfore, which may be ſomewhat when the things are doon, but is very ſmal or none at al rather, before the yſſue cometh; is no note of the perſecution of Antichriſt.</p>

And shal he have leyſure alſo to build a Temple, and ſit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? But, I pray you, shal he make this journey togither with his armie, or himſelfe alone? It may be, that as the Monk of Oxford, being caried by his familiar Divil through the aier, deſcribed in an Aſtrolobe the whole Northern Climate; ſo Antichriſt may mount on ſome ſuch like winged Pegaſus, and may provide his armie ſuch horſes alſo, and then in every na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion whiles he flyeth over the countries, he may with the clapping of his wings onely compel true religion to keepe ſilence. It may alſo be, that he wil ſpare his own payns, and wil goe over the countries by his Legates: yet I beleev he shall have ynough to doo, everie day to give commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto ſo large a dominion as he is to adminiſter. But in this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſo deep ſilence of true religion, wher shal your <hi>Henoch</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> be? ſhal not they oppoſe themſelves; or shal they doo it in vain, <hi>out of whoſe mouth fyre cometh forth, conſuming their adverſaries?</hi> Apoc. 11.6. But what doo I mean? Are you not ashamed of ſuch monſtrous opinions as theſe? Such ſtrange fantaſies are rather to be hiſſed away, than to be refuted by anie ſerious diſputation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Daniel dooth plainly teach this point, chapt. 12. in theſe words: From the time that the dayly ſacrifice ſhalbe taken away,</hi> ſhalbe <hi>1200 dayes; as the
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:6819:279"/> ancient Fathers doo expound it; and the meaning it, that Antichriſt ſhal forbid all divine worship, that now is exerciſed in the Chriſtian Churches, and ſpecially the holy ſacrifice of the Euchariſt. And experience teſtifieth that this ſigne is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</hi> I anſwer, that Daniel treateth of nothing leſſe in that place, than of Antichriſt. The Fathers that ſo expound it, wil have this number of dayes that is mentioned, to be of his reign: but inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratlie, as the words doe ſufficientlie shew. For if theſe be the dayes of his reign, he shal make all publik religion to ceaſe, before his reign beginn. For theſe dayes take their beginning, from the daily ſacrifice being taken away; which therfore muſt needs goe before. Wherfore eyther theſe things perteyn nothing at al to Antichriſt, or al thoſe things are vayn which the Fathers mention of him, whiles they thruſt al his tyrannie into the ſtraights of ſo few dayes. Ther is no ſoundnes therfore in this their expoſition: the true ſacrifice which Daniel meaneth, is the dayly ſacrifice, which was taken away befor Antichriſt was born; for it was taken away togither with the Temple of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruſalem, unto which it was tyed by the inſtitution of God. For al this Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pheſie is of the children of Daniels people, that is, of the Iewes, as the An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gel ſpeaketh in the firſt verſe of that chapter. <hi>Not ſo,</hi> ſay you, <hi>but this dayly ſacrifice, is our ſacrifice of the altar, which ſucceeded in place of that old.</hi> Away with this dotage, and ſacrilegious ſacrifice, which neither Chriſt inſtituted, nor the Apoſtles knew of, nor the purer Church ever dreamed of. Should ther be anie daylie ſacrifice now in the Church, beſides that of thankſgiving, &amp; of a contrite hart, after that Chriſt <hi>in the midds of that week,</hi> as the Angel ſpeaketh, abolished al ſacrifice and offring? Dan. 9.27. &amp;c. Should not the ſacrifice of himſelfe alone, be the onely and perfect ſacrifice: as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſo often teſtifieth to the Hebrews? chap. 7. ver. 27. But many are your blaſphemies that from hence ariſe, neither to be ſtood on at this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. It is ynough for us in this place, that the ceaſing of this ſacrifice, is without the compaſſe of the 1290. daies: and therfore not rightly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto Antichriſt. But this place is ſertile, and three notable points are gathered from it: <hi>Firſt, that Antichriſt is not yet come whiles the daily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice dooth ſtill continue.</hi> I anſwer; you may as certainly conclude, that he is not yet come, becauſe the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Ieruſalem, dooth ſtil remayn whole. <hi>Secondly,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the Biſhop of Rome is not Antichriſt, but moſt contrary unto him; ſeing the ſacrifice which he ſhal take away, this man moſt adorneth and defendeth.</hi> I anſwer, Antichriſt ſhal take away nothing leſſe, than your ſacrilegious ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: than which, nothing is more contumelious againſt Chriſt. For if Chriſt profiteth them nothing, which bring in circumciſion: they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from grace, which bring in the dayly ſacrifice, Gal. 5.2. But <hi>yours,</hi> you
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:6819:280"/> wil ſay, <hi>is not the legal rite.</hi> I anſwer, it is ſo much the more impious, in that it is merely humane and Popiſh. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that the Heretiks of this time, are above al other, the fore-runners of Antichriſt, for that they deſire nothing more earneſtly, than utterly to aboliſh the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt,</hi> I anſwer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Satan had blinded your eyes, thoſe whom you cal Heretiks and fore-runners of Antichriſt, you would acknowledge them to be the fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Chriſt: foraſmuch as of his great mercy he uſeth them, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth to deſtroy the Pope, who is by al toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s famouſly known to be Antichriſt; and whom now verie ſhortly at laſt, he wil utterly <hi>aboliſh with the brightnes of his coming,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.8. But it is no marvel that yow which count Antichriſt for the Vicar of Chriſt: doe cal Chriſts true ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts by anie name rather than their owne. And now it were to be wiſhed, that Antichriſt might no more attayn to the Saincts by perſecuting, than yow have attayned to anie part of this queſtion by diſputing: for ſo, his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution would be tolerable, as your diſputation is intolerable.</p>

                        <p>THE <hi>fift Demonſtration</hi> you draw from <hi>Antichriſts durance,</hi> which yow make to be <hi>but three yeres and a halfe. But ſeing the Pope hath now reigned</hi> you ſay, <hi>ſpiritually in the Church, theſe 1500. yeres, neither can anie be named, that was counted Antichriſt, which reigned preciſely three yeres and a halfe; the Pope is not Antichriſt: and therfore Antichriſt is not yet come.</hi> I anſwer, how vayn this opinion of three yeres and a halfe is, I have shewed by moſt firm argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments from the Scriptures. For if Antichriſt have reigned from the time of Conſtantine the Great, unto this day, wherof the Apocalyps hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch demonſtrations, as no Ieſuit shal ever confute: then is ther nothing more frivolous, than that three yeres reign and a halfe. But the proper ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gument of this place, is to be taken from the things that folow, chap. 20.6. whence playnly it is gathered, that ſome part of his reign ſhal dure a thouſand yeres; for thus he ſayth: <hi>And J ſaw the ſoules of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for the witneſſe of Ieſus, and for the word of God, and which worſhiped not the Beaſt, nor his Jmage, nor had taken his mark on their foreheads, or on their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeres. But the reſt of the dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lived not, til the thouſand yeres were fulfilled. This is the firſt reſurrection.</hi> From hence it is evident, <hi>firſt,</hi> that Antichriſts adverſaries doo reign a thouſand yeres with Chriſt, before the firſt reſurrection. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that Antichriſts ubiects, that dyed by his tyranny, lay dead 1000 yeres. But ther can be
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:6819:280"/> no expoſition againſt Antichriſt, whiles yet he is not: neither is he able to hold his people dead 1000 yeres, u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>leſſe his tyrannie should ſo many yeres endure. Therfore ſome part of his reign, is for 1000 yeres: a <hi>part,</hi> I ſay; for theſe thouſand yeres, are not thoſe whol 1260, dayes, but ſome part onely, as in their places is more apparant. But let us ſee, how you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm thoſe three yeres and a halfe. For this thing, you uſe ſix arguments. Firſt from Dan. 7.25. and 12.7. Apoc. 12.19. <hi>where we read,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſts reign ſhal dure for a time, and times, and halfe a time. For by a time, is meant, one yere; by times, two yeres; by halfe a time, halfe a yere. And that ſo John explayneth it, for in Apoc. 11. &amp; 13. he confirmeth that Antichriſt ſhal reign 42 moneths, which juſtly make three yeres and a halfe. And in chap. 11. Henoch &amp; Elias are to preach 1260 dayes, which make up the ſame time. Neither dooth it lett, that in Dan. 12. it is ſayd Antichriſt ſhal reign 1290 dayes, that is, 30. dayes more than John ſpake of for John ſpeaks of Henoch and Elias, which ſhalbe ſlayn by An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt, one moneth before Antichriſt doo periſh.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, that you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully joyn Daniel in this thing with Iohn. For that <hi>time, times, &amp; part of a time</hi> in Daniel, perteyn nothing to Antichriſt, and to this <hi>time, times, and halfe a time</hi> in Iohn, ſave ſo farr as ſome ſimilitude and alluſion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. For that in Daniel is of a little horn; which is not the great Antichriſt, whom Iohn ſpeaketh of in this place. For he riſeth up after the other ten horns: Antichriſt is born togither with his ten. Alſo, he gets do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minion but over three horns: contrariweiſe Antichriſt prevaileth over all his: as is shewed before, chap. 5. againſt your ſecond demonſtration. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I ſay, that you plainly know not the account in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring the dayes moneths and yeres. For wheras you ſay, <hi>that the ful and perfect yere of the Moon conteyneth 12 moneths, and everie moneth 30. daies, as Auguſtine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth;</hi> that is not true. For ſuch a yere of the Moon, should have 360. dayes: but the Hebreues yere of the Moon, had onely 354 dayes, &amp; ſome houres and minutes over; as al the Rabbines, Calendars, &amp; Cycles of the Hebrues doo ſhew; who are more to be beleeved in the computation of their owne time, than Auguſtine is, though otherweiſe a very learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore, if you wil have theſe to be the yeres of the Hebrewes; three ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and a half, wil make but 1239 dayes, which want 21 of the number in the Apocalyps. Moreover, wher you make thoſe 1290 dayes in Dan. 12. to be alſo of Antichriſts reign; beſides that which we have shewed in the former chapter, how it can no way be referred hereunto, ſee how great a new contrariety you make in the account. For neither dooth this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fall under the reckning of the time times and halfe a time, ſeing it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided into three whole ones and a halfe; neither agreeth it with
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:6819:281"/> Iohn, who numbreth preciſely 1260 dayes. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>this number is of the death of Henoch and Elias, whom Antichriſt ſhal ſurvive one moneth.</hi> Vnto this I ſay, then Antichriſt shal reign not onely <hi>three yeres and ſix moneths,</hi> as Ireneus ſaith expreſſely in the end of his 5. book: neither <hi>three yeres and a halfe onelie,</hi> with an excluſive particle, as Cyril ſpeaketh, Catecheſ. 25. but a moneth over the number shal now be added, and for 6. moneths ther shalbe 7. Neither shal the <hi>halfe of a time</hi> prefigure ſix, as Ierom ſaith on Dan. 7. but ſeven. And thus, while you goe about to make Daniel &amp; Iohn agree, you ſet the Fathers againſt them both. But let us leave theſe diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greers, and draw the truth out of the true fountains. I confeſſe that the number of 1290 dayes, is not of Antichriſts whole reign, but is ended at the death of the two Prophets, whoſe names I now ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not upon; &amp; that Antichriſt shal ſurvive they two being ſlain: but not one moneth onely, as you falſlie ſuppoſe, but manie yeres, the number wherof we have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red elſwhere: which thing verilie is from hence manifeſted. For the two Prophets are killed under the ſixt trumpet, chap. 11.8.14. and Antichr. perisheth under the laſt, which comprehendeth 7 other plagues caled <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> under the laſt wherof, he is quite abolished. Shal therfore al the ſeven vials have their effects in thoſe your 30. dayes? So four daies shalbe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted for the execution of everie one: for they are not powred out al togi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, and confuſedly: but the ſame order and courſe is kept doubtleſſe in the executing, that is kept in the declaring. Wherfore, to let paſſe the five firſt vials, thoſe <hi>unclean Spirits</hi> of the ſixt, which come out of the mouth of the Dragon, of the Beaſt, and of the falſe Prophet, and goe forth unto the Kings of the whole earth, to gather them togither unto battel; shal they effect al this in the four daies next before the laſt? We have heard of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts incredible ſwiftnes, going over the whole earth in ſo ſmal a ſpace of his reign: but greater shalbe the ſpeed of theſe his miniſters, who shal both ſurvey the whole earth in foure daies, and bring forth unto battell verie populous armies. Verilie this expedition is moſt expedite or ſoon diſpatched: and ſuch as onelie deſerveth properly the name of an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Doo you not yet perceive how falſe, abſurd, trifling, and mere igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance the things are which you babble about theſe matters? When yow shal prove that the <hi>ſeven laſt plagues</hi> shal be al to be accomplished in 30. daies; we wil aſſent unto you that Antichriſt shal ſurvive the two ſlain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, one moneth onelie; as alſo that ther is an agreement of theſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Daniel and Iohn: in the meane while we wil determine that theſe two have their divers intendements, and doo not Propheſie of the ſame things by theſe numbers. Thirdly I ſay, although that whol indefinite
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:6819:281"/> ſpace did conſiſt with moſt exact agreement, of thoſe eyther moneths or daies; yet are yow never the neerer for obteining your purpoſe. For the queſtion is, whither thoſe <hi>moneths</hi> or <hi>daies</hi> or <hi>yeres</hi> be to be taken properly or no, not whither the account doo agree; which may agree alike, whither they be taken properlie or figurativelie: ſeing there is the ſame proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the type and the truth; though neither the type be the truth, nor the truth the type. How therfore doo you prove, that they are to be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perlie? <hi>By teſtimonie</hi> you ſay, <hi>of the Fathers,</hi> ſome of which you bring forth in the anſwer to Chytreus, and the men of <hi>Maydenburgh.</hi> I anſwer. thoſe ancient Fathers are to be pardonned, that being ignorant of the event, thought they should hold faſt unto the letter: but ſeing manie things are now made clear by the iſſue, whoſoever dooth abuſe the patronage of their names, to confirm himſelf in errour, he ſhal procure on his own head juſt condemnation. Therfore you muſt eyther bring forth ſome thing of greater weight; or freely confeſſe, that that reign of 3. yeres and a halfe, hath no defenſe from theſe Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> you prove it by this, <hi>that the time of the Divil looſed, and of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhould be verie ſhort; as Apoc. 12.12. Woe to the land and ſea, for the Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a little ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi> I anſwer, a little and indefinite time concludetht nothing at al, for a certain and definite reign of 3. yeres and a halfe: ſo that little help or none rather you get from this place. Moreover, that which you cal the time of <hi>the Divil looſed,</hi> is the time of <hi>the Divil bound:</hi> who ſo ſoone as he was caſt out of heaven, was caſt into priſon. For everie place is to him lothſome, &amp; like a priſon, without the aſſemblie of the Saincts, among whom he moſt coveteth to converſe, for greater oportunitie to his wickednes: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord ſaith, that <hi>the unclean Spirit being caſt out of a man, walketh through dry places,</hi> as in which ther is no pleaſure for his minde, Mat. 12.43. &amp;c. But theſe things we have made evident in explayning the Propheſie. Seing therfore the Divils priſonment is for 1000 yeres, &amp; here that time is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of wherunto you wil have Antichriſts durance to be equal: his reign ſhalbe much longer by this place, than you are willing to grant. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>how can ſo manie yeres be a little time?</hi> I anſwer, if the words be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpreted, here is no mention of durance, but of opportunitie. For wher you read, <hi>knowing that he hath but a litle time,</hi> it is properlie thus, <hi>knowing that he hath litle opportunity.</hi> So <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> properlie ſignifieth, noting the qualitie of time, not the quantitie, wherby it is diſtinguiſhed from <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius sheweth. And reaſon convinceth that ſo it is to be taken in this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. If it ſhould be underſtood <hi>durance,</hi> the Divil should be angry for the
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:6819:282"/> thouſand yeres of his priſon, (in which he liveth, by thoſe words, as we have ſaid;) as being bound for a leſſer ſpace than he would. Which how farr it is from his diſpoſition, his diligence night and day to deſtroy men, dooth ſufficiently shew. The time therfore was longer than he deſired, but the opportunity litle: leav being now given him onelie over his own, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had rather ſpare, and shew his crueltie on the elect. Wherfore this pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce is nothing to the matter, for many cauſes. The ſecond is, Apoc. 20.3 <hi>he bound him for a 1000. yeres, and afterwards he muſt be looſed for a litle time.</hi> I anſwer, now in deed he ſpeaketh of <hi>time;</hi> and therfore wheras before it was <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> whiles he lay in bands; now it is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>time,</hi> when he is looſed. <hi>But how</hi> ſay you, <hi>ſhal this be true, if Antichriſt ſhal reign 1260 yeres?</hi> I anſwer, this is not the looſing of Antichriſt, but of the Divil; that his time is ſhort, but Antichriſts time long, who reigneth not onely when the Divil is looſed, but alſo when he is bound; as Apoc. 20.3.4. wher the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is bound 1000. yeres, whiles the Beaſt in the meane time is deſpiſed of the elect, but dominiereth over his owne, by his Mark, and other ſignes of ſervitude; as upon that place shalbe ſpoken more at large. <hi>Thirdly</hi> you ſay, <hi>becauſe as Auguſtine and Gregorie doo reaſon, except that greevous perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on ſhould be very ſhort, many ſhould periſh, which are not for to periſh, wherupon our Lord alſo ſaith, unleſſe thoſe dayes were ſhortned, no fleſh ſhould be ſaved,</hi> Mat. 24.22. I anſwer; this of Matthew, agrees not to the perſecution of Antichriſt, but to the affliction of Ieruſalem. What flight ſhall ther be under your An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt, (ſuch as there is mentioned,) when al the world ſhal plainlie obey him? Or what shal the Sabbath hurt Chriſtians that flee? Or how shall new falſe Prophets have place, after your great Antichriſt, who shal come you ſay, a litle before the end of the world? how be it after that affliction, the Lord foretelleth that ſuch, shal come a freſh: ver. 24. Therfore what names ſoever you pretend for this interpretation, ther is no firmnes in it. Moreover, if I should grant that this perſecution is both Antichriſts, and short: what is this for 3. yeres and a halfe? The Spirit ſaid to the Angel of Epheſus, unleſſe thou repent, I wil come againſt thee shortly, Apoc. 2.5. Was that Angel punished within 3. yeres and a halfe? Therfore here is no probabilitie of Antichriſts durance, but this your Demonſtration is like your other. This alſo I wil tel you of in as word, though it perteyns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the force of the argument, that you had rather ſpeak amiſſe <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhould periſh, which are not to periſh,</hi> then to ſay with the Scripture, <hi>that they should deceive, if it were poſſible the verie elect.</hi> For that which the Lord ſaith, <hi>no fleſh ſhould be ſaved,</hi> he ſpake of the deſtruction of the fleſh, with greevouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the ſlaughter: not of the peril of ſalvation of ſoules.</p>
                        <pb n="549" facs="tcp:6819:282"/>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly</hi> you ſay, <hi>Chriſt preached onely three yeres and a halfe; therfore it is meet alſo that Antichriſt be permitted to preach no longer.</hi> I anſwer, you are a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſputer verilie. Wil you have Chriſt, to be a type of Antichriſt? If it were ſo appointed, the agreement of yeres would perhaps be meet: but being as you mind, they directly croſſe one an other, it is rather meet all things should be contrarie; namely that Antichriſt should reign very lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, becauſe Chriſt did it ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie in the world a verie short time. So alſo ſhould Chriſts glory appear the greater in ſubduing this enemie: the longer that his tyrannie hath continued. Enemies doo not ſet themſelves to imitate their enemies: and in manie other things they are quite contrarie. For as Chriſt was verie poor; ſo Antichriſt is verie rich: as Chriſt was a ſubiect, ſo Antichriſt is a King: as Chriſt patiently ſuffred al injuries, ſo Antichriſt ſtudiouſly inferreth them: as Chriſt had not where to lay his head, ſo An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth with ſo great wealth, as he is alſo able to carie the whore.

But what letteth, I pray you, the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto theſe words of Iohn? Becauſe <hi>by a time,</hi> you ſay, <hi>without doubt muſt be underſtood ſome one number, as one day, one week, one moneth, one yere, one five-yeres-tide, one Jubilee, one hundred-yeres, one thouſand &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, but you without doubt are egregiouſly deceived: neither doo I thing that you w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rote theſe things waking, but a ſleep, or nodding. Doo not you ſee, that by this reaſon, you reiect not onelie the yeres of the adverſaries, but even the daies and moneths which the Angel himſelfe ſetteth? <hi>A time,</hi> you ſay, <hi>muſt be doubtleſſe ſome one number, as one day, one week, one moneth, &amp;c.</hi> Be it therfore <hi>one day,</hi> then <hi>times</hi> shalbe <hi>two dayes,</hi> half<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So let a <hi>time</hi> be <hi>one moneth, times</hi> wilbe <hi>two moneths,</hi> halfe a time, 15. <hi>dayes;</hi> al which ioyned togither, make three moneths and 15. dayes; wil the 42. moneths be brought at length to theſe? But I will not aske too lowd leaſt I be trobleſome to your ſleepy head: I wil whiſper to you as low as I can, that <hi>a time of dayes,</hi> is not one day, but three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixtie dayes; <hi>times,</hi> are twiſe as manie, namely 720: <hi>halfe a time,</hi> 180. Likeweiſe alſo <hi>a time</hi> of yeres, is 360. yeres; <hi>times,</hi> 720. <hi>halfe a time,</hi> 180. So <hi>a time</hi> of moneths, is 12. moneths; <hi>times,</hi> 24. <hi>halfe a time,</hi> ſix Theſe things, when you are awake, think on, I pray you: and in the mean time dream ſweetly thoſe 3400. yeree which by your account you have wrung

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixtly,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the 7. times in Daniel chap. 9. are ſeven yeres; if they ſhould be taken otherweiſe, ſo manie dayes for ſo manie yeres, Nabuchodonoſor had lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Kingdome two thouſand five hundred fifty and five yeres. Therfore one time in Iohn, ſhalbe one uſual yere, and 2. times 2. yeres, and ſo forward.</hi> I anſwer, it is ridiculous to tie words alwayes unto one ſignification, except where cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayn reaſon, and neceſsity doo conſtreyn. Daniel himſelfe is ſayd to <hi>have fallen on hes knees three times in a day;</hi> I think you wil not have it that he fell on his knees <hi>three yeres in a day,</hi> Dan. 6.11. And thus now you have diſpu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted of Antichriſts three yeres reign, as beſides the bare names of ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are not meet witneſſes in this matter, you have nothing which may hold eyther you or any other Papiſt in this opinion: yea (I may ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more and truly,) wherof you and al Papiſts may not wel be aſhamed, which ſuffer your ſelves to be deceyved in ſo great a matter, with ſuch leight and childiſh toyes. God grant, the truth be not now alſo shewd you in vayn, as it hath been heretofore. Ther remayneth one thing in this chapter to be conſidered, which you anſwer unto the argument of Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, wher you ſay, <hi>that in the Scripture ther is found indeed &amp; rightly ſayd</hi> weeks <hi>of</hi> yeres, <hi>but not</hi> dayes, <hi>for yeres, or</hi> moneths of yeres: <hi>and that it is rightly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a</hi> week, <hi>becauſe it hath the name of the number</hi> ſeven: <hi>but moneths and dayes are names of number, but of the courſe of the man, or time of light.</hi> I anſwer, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as firſt you ſay that dayes are not found for <hi>yeres:</hi> it is manifeſtly falſe. Saith not the Lord to the Iſraelits, <hi>according to the number of the dayes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſerched the land, even fourtie dayes, you ſhal bear your iniquities fourtie yeres?</hi> Num. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. what can be plainer? Likeweiſe unto Ezechiel, <hi>A day for a yere have J given thee:</hi> chap. 9.6. <hi>But,</hi> ſay you, <hi>he wil not ſay, for dayes literally are meant yeres, but the dayes are truly taken for yeres, and they are ſayd to be given for yeres, becauſe they were a ſigne of yeres.</hi> O witt, worthy of Neeſing wort! A day is not a very yere, but onely a ſigne or ſignification of a yere: as if any ever thought a <hi>day</hi> to be a <hi>yere</hi> truly and properlie? Or if a <hi>day</hi> might ſignify a <hi>yere</hi> in Ezechiel, &amp; other places, but might not in Iohn? But now let us hear the reaſon why a <hi>week</hi> may be of yeres, and not a <hi>day</hi> likeweiſe: forſooth <hi>becauſe a week ſignifieth number; a day not.</hi> To this I ſay, unitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not number, and a day anſwereth to unitie, and this verie ſubtilly. How be it we dullars doo think that number is the gathering togither of unities; &amp; that unities ar ſuch as is the whole it ſelfe which is made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore as 7 dayes ſignify 7 yeres; ſo I pray you with your good leav, let it be lawful for one day to ſignify one yere: which if you wil let us obteyn at your hands; in thanks for ſo great a benefit, we wil grant your Pope a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g laſting reign, even 1260. yeres</p>

                        <head>Chapt. 9. Against the ſixt Demonſtration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the end of the world.</head>
                        <p>THE ſixt Demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is taken from the laſt ſign that foloweth Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which shalbe <hi>the end of the world. If Antichriſt,</hi> ſay you, <hi>had bin come long ſince, the world had been at an end long ſince; for he is to come a litle before the end of the world: but the world is not yet ended: therfore he is not yet come.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer, If that of Antichriſts three yeres reign, had been certayn; this which you ſay, should have ſome weight: but foraſmuch as we have proved that to be a vayn fiction, partly by taking away your reaſons, partly by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding ſuch as you wil never be able to refute; the end of the world maie wel teach Antichriſts end, but is of no force at al to demonſtrate his coming, if we wil ſpeake of it properlie. From the places by you cited, ſom perhaps may argue thus. The end of the world is conioyned with the end of Antichriſt: but the end of the world is not yet come; therfore neyther the end of Antichriſt. But what is this to the purpoſe? We make queſtion of his <hi>comming,</hi> not of his <hi>end.</hi> You might have ſpared this labour; unleſſe perhaps you thought theſe were to be prepared againſt a new battel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichriſts caſe shalbe debated in hell. There this domonſtration may hav ſom weight, wher it ſhalbe certaynly known whither the Pope be periſhed, togither with the deſtruction of al the world, or no. VVherfore the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which you bring are quite from the purpoſe, and make nothing for the matter in hand. Yea what and if they prove not that <hi>end</hi> which you think? Then wil this your demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be altogither both without head and tayl. Let us ſee in few words, that we may alſo illuſtrate as it were by the way ſome obſcure places; whoſe meaning it wilbe verie profitable for to know. Firſt you allege that of Dan. ch. 7.9. <hi>J conſidered the horns &amp; loe an other litle horn came up, &amp; three of the firſt horns were pluckt away from before him. I beheld til the thrones were ſet up, and the ancient of dayes did ſit &amp;c.</hi> And afterwards explaining the viſion, he ſaith, <hi>The fou th Beaſt ſhalbe the fourth Kingdome: and the ten horns ar ten Kings, &amp; an other ſhal riſe up after them, &amp; he ſhalbe mightier than the former, &amp; ſhal ſubdue three Kings &amp;c. And they ſhal be given into his hand for a time &amp; times &amp; halfe a time, &amp; iudgement ſhal ſit.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, neither is the <hi>litle horn, the Antichriſt,</hi> as we hav shewed neither if he were, dooth his end lead unto the knowledge of that coming But leaving theſe, let us weigh for what cauſe this is cited. From theſe words yow would teach that the end should ſtraightway folow that litle horn. But you ought to have conſidered withal the words after, in ver. 14. <hi>&amp; to him was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; glorie &amp; kingdom, that al peoples natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; tongues ſhould ſerve him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="552" facs="tcp:6819:284"/>
                        <p>That is, he which shal obteyn the Kingdom, when the litle horne is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, shalbe an univerſal King, unto whom al nations shal obey. But shal ther remain a diſtinction of peoples, nations, and tongues, after the laſt end? yet is it more playne after, if plainer may be, in verſe 27. <hi>And the Kingdome, and amplitude, and rule of Kingdomes, ſhalbe given to the people of the holy moſt High, whoſe Kingdome ſhalbe a perpetual Kingdome, and al Rulers ſhal ſerve it.</hi> VVher firſt it is to be obſerved, that the dominion of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, shalbe of the things under heaven: then, that it shalbe the holy Moſt-High; and finally, that al rulers shal ſerve this Kingdome: which things cannot have place in the heavenlie Kingdome. The thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>s thus; that litle horne is the <hi>Turk,</hi> who being at laſt extinguished, the Iewes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting univerſallie al of them unto the faith, shal have a perpetual domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that shal dure until the coming of our Lord from heaven. For the litle horn in Daniel, is <hi>Gog</hi> in Ezechiel, who being ſlayn, the Chriſtian faith shal exceedingly flourish among the Iewes, as is shewed by that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical building of the Temple &amp; new Citie. The ſame reaſon is of the new Ieruſalem in this Apocalypſe, after Gog is ſlain, ch. 20.21. Theſe things we have partly taken out of the 16. chap. of the Apocalypſe; partly they shal be explayned hereafter more fully. And this is that which Lactantius writeth, lib. 7. chap. 15. <hi>The name of Rome,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wherwith the world now is ruled, (my hart is afraid to ſpeake it, but ſpeake it I wll, becauſe it ſhal come to paſſe) shalbe taken away from the earth, and the Empire shal returne into Aſia; &amp; the Eaſt again shal have dominion, and the Weſt shal ſerve.</hi> The ſecond place is Ap. 20.4 <hi>After this he muſt be looſed a litle time: and I ſaw ſeats, and they ſate upon them, and iudgement was given unto them.</hi> I anſwer, theſe things are farr from the laſt end. For they folow not as you think after the Divil is looſed; but theſe ſeats are placed during his impriſonment. Againe, there are 1000 yeres before the firſt reſurrection; then they that firſt riſe, doo reign 1000 yeres, as is expreſſely ſaid ver. 6. Therfore theſe ſeats and this iudgement. which you ſuppoſe to be of the laſt end. doo goe before it 2000 yeres at leaſt; ſuch a ſtranger are you in theſe myſteries. Then to that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged out of Dan. 12. <hi>Bleſſed is he that wayteth and cometh unto the 1335 dayes, that is,</hi> ſay you, <hi>unto 45 dayes after Antichriſts death, for then the Lord shal com to iudgment, and wil give the crowns of righteouſnes to them that overcome.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, as touching this place, we are to explain it after, chap. 20.11. and it may be one day we wil take in hand the ful handling of it. In the meane while let us know, that the deſtruction of Antichriſt properly ſo caled, is not here handled, nor our Lords coming to the laſt judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which shall not make al <hi>bleſſed</hi> upon whom it cometh, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manie shal deſire that they
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:6819:284"/> may be covered by the mountains from his ſight: but the ful caling of the Iewes, where Daniel ſtayeth his Propheſie; neither doo anie Propheſies go further.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly you come unto Mat. 24. <hi>this Goſpel of the Kingdome shalbe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the whole world, for a teſtimonie to al nations, and then shal the end be.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer, here is no mention of your Antichriſt: and again, the <hi>end</hi> in this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, is the end of the Iewish politie, not of the world, as I have shewed ch. <hi>4.</hi> againſt your <hi>firſt Demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But you add the words folowing; <hi>Straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after the tribulation of thoſe dayes, the Sun shalbe darkned, and the Moon shal not give her light, and then shal appeare the ſign of the Son of man.</hi> I anſwer, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dooth theſe make anie thing for Antichriſts deſtruction to be ioyned with the end of al things, ſeing they ſpeak not of him at al. Yet that wee may ſee the interpretation of the words, let us diſcuſſe them a litle. VVith one conſent, as I ſuppoſe, it is applyed unto our Lords laſt judgment. But this Apocalypſs teacheth both to think and to ſpeak more diſtinctly of this thing. For from hence we doo underſtand, that the Lords coming which is yet to be hereafter, is twofold; the one ſpiritual (ſo named for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie,) in the caling of the Iewes; the other corporal, at the general iudgment. And that coming in Mathew, ſeemeth to be ſpiritual, which is in deed deſcribed to be moſt glorious and powrful, by the corporal furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as that which shalbe both a clear reſemblance and as it were a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn pawn therof, &amp; alſo no change shal afterward come between, which may make the corporal to appear as new And that thus the thing is, may eaſily be perceived, if we mind how the Diſciples in the beginning of the chapter inquired of the end of the Temple, of the Lords coming, and the end of the world. VVithout doubt under Chriſts coming they comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reſtoring of their nation: and therfore after the Lords reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuppoſing that this was the coming which he had give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them hope of; they aske him agayn, <hi>Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdome to Iſrael?</hi> Act. 1.6. But Chriſt anſwering, and by a continued order proſecuting the things to come, teacheth firſt the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and diſsipatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iewes: then he annexeth the reſt of the courſe of things, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie where mentioneth he anie reſtoring, before this his glorious coming. Therfore it muſt eyther be conteyned in this his appearing, or ther wil be none: which opinion, if the Diſciples had in mind conceived by this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſurely they would not have nourished any exſpectation of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome afterwards. Beſides, a <hi>tribulation</hi> next goeth before this coming, for ſo he ſaith, <hi>immediatly after the tribulation of thoſe dayes, the Sun shalbe darkned; and then shal appeare the ſign of the Sun of man &amp;c.</hi> But before his corporal
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:6819:285"/> coming, no ſuch tributation ſhal goe immediatly before. For after the ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling of the Iewes, and the new conſtituted Church, God wil wipe awaie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie tear from their eies, and death shalbe no more, neither shal mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor crying, nor ſorow be anie more, for the former things are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away; Apoc. 21.4. VVherfore that coming is not corporal. It may be alſo that hath ſome force, which he ſaith that <hi>the ſigne of the Son of man ſhall appear;</hi> as if purpoſely he would diſtinguish between this ſpiritual coming, and the corporal folowing. Hereunto perteyneth, that thoſe words <hi>All the Tribes shal wail &amp;c.</hi> Apoc. 1 7. we have there shewed to belong unto the Iewes; and that this <hi>wailing</hi> is of repentance, which wilbe too late at the corporal coming. Thus much breifly touching the meaning of theſe words: which though they help your cauſe nothing, how ever they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; yet was it not impertinent by the way to ſeek out the truth that is hidd in them.</p>
                        <p>Therfore I anſwer unto that Theſſ. 2.8. <hi>Then shal the wicked man be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whom the Lord shal ſlay with the Spirit of his mouth, &amp; deſtroy with the bright<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of his coming:</hi> ther is the ſame meaning of this <hi>coming,</hi> that is of that in Mathew. At the caling of the Iewes, when he shal give a moſt bright rese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of himſelfe preſent in the Church, shal Antichriſt utterly be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed: as we made playn in the former chapter. For after the throne of the Beaſt is darkned, the way shalbe prepared for the Kings of the Eaſt; that is, the Iewes shalbe caled ſtraight after Rome is deſtroyed. For shee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindreth this ioy. Then, after the Beaſt and Falſe Prophet and Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are cut off; that is, after the Biſhop of Rome, and the Turk be extinct (as after shalbe shewed more at large;) the myſterie shalbe finished, and the ful caling performed, Your Pope, whom you, Bellarmine, boaſt to be the head of the Church, shal neither be head nor foot in the holy congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the children of God. And now ſee how farr theſe mountayns are under heaven; whoſe tops, you ſtanding a farr off did think, were hidden among the ſtarrs.</p>
                        <p>The laſt place is 1 Iohn. 2.18. <hi>Children it is the laſt hour, and as you have heard that Antichriſt cometh, even now ther are manie Antichriſts, wherby wee know that it is the laſt hour.</hi> I anſwer, what Iohn here concludeth, we eaſily ſee and acknowledge: he proveth that it is the laſt hour, becauſe then ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie Antichriſts were come. For Antichriſt should come in the laſt hour. VVhere is to be obſerved, that Iohn alluding to the parable of the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Mat. 20.6. of whom ſome were hyred about the eleventh hour: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth al this age from Chriſt until his laſt coming, unto this laſt eleve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th hour. Then, that he ſaith this noyſome age shalbe of Antichriſt, whom he
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:6819:285"/> putteth not off unto the laſt minute of this howr, but deferrs him to ſome indefinite ſpace therof. Theſe things dooth Iohn truly, holily, agreably, to his other writings. But what muſt you needs conclude from hence; who wil not have Antichriſt to be yet come? Even thus, and no other way: He that ſhal come in the laſt howr, he is not yet come; Antichriſt ſhal come in the laſt howr; therfore he is not yet come. I bring it into form, that you may ſee your uſual manner of reaſoning, and be ashamed. Your ſylogiſm walks on fowr feet. In the major, by the <hi>laſt howr</hi> you underſtand ſome litle ſpace, to weet, 3. yeres and a halfe before the laſt end: or otherweiſe, if it comprehend al the time from the firſt coming to the ſecond, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is moſt falſe. In the minor, <hi>the laſt howr</hi> is taken in the ſenſe that Iohn uſeth it, for the whole time of grace, until Chriſts ſecond coming: or if it be taken more ſtrictly for 3. yeres and a halfe, it is a fooliſh begging of the queſtion, and Iohns authoritie is pretended in vayn. You bring a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litude to illuſtrate Iohns argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, namely that he ſpeaketh of Antichriſt, as one may doo of the Sun, whoſe beams when it ariſeth he caleth the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that ſo his argument is firm. <hi>Even as one may raiſon of the laſt howr of the night, the Sun riſeth in the laſt howr of the night: the Sun beams doo now lighten the aier; therfore this is the laſt howr of the night.</hi> I anſwer, the ſimilitude is fitt y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Apoſtle uſeth: for alwaies in the ſame howr the Sun beams and the Sun it ſelfe are ſeen. Wherupon he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth al this laſt age, <hi>one howr;</hi> dooth not amiſſe, to mention his fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the beginning of it. But you that make the laſt howr to be 3 yeres and a halfe: what help ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you have by the ſimilitude of the Sun &amp; beams? For if you part the howr into ſixtie minutes, Antichriſts forre-ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners doe come before him no more than 210. yeres. What are theſe few yeres, un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the 1500. yeres, in al which you grant Antichriſts beams have been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and yet hitherto he hath not appeared; and when at length he ſhall appear, he ſhalbe to be ſeen but 3 yeres and a halfe? How unlike is he to the Sun? And how unlike are his miniſters to the beams? The beams goe ſcarcely half an howr before the Sun; which ſtraightway ariſing yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſelfe to be ſeen 12. houres: but theſe forerunners of Antichriſt doe gliſter 1500. yeres, and Antichriſt himſelfe is not yet appeared; and when he shal be come, he shal not shine one minute in reſpect of that ſpace. If therfore Antichriſt be anſwerable to his forerunners, as the Sun is to his beams: he muſt needs be come now many ages ſince, ſeing his fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shined in Iohns time. Take heed hereafter how you have to doo with the Sun. This <hi>Delius</hi> as his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner is, hideth not vices, but diſcloſeth them. At laſt, from ſcriptures you deſcend to the conſent of Fathers, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſsion
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:6819:286"/> of adverſaries. They with their conſent wil help you nothing, who al of them verily, if they were this day alive, would with like conſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that in manie things they erred. I confeſſe alſo, that our men doe think Antichriſt shal reign til the worlds end: but I pray you, let them have place to change their minde, when they are taught better. In things not yet ſufficientlie found out, they think it ſufficient to inſiſt in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtepps of other men: but when they shal ſee the truth, (to whoſe voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone they know for to hearken,) shine from another part, being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by moſt ſure arguments and uſe, you shal perceive that they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from you, wil leave you naked, of whoſe confeſsion you now doo boaſt.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things thus finished, you come to the inſoluble Demonſtration, fetched partly from Antichriſts three yeres reign, and partly from the worlds diſsolution conioyned with his death. <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is not yet come, neither is the Biſhop of Rome he: becauſe ſtraight-after Antichriſts death, the world ſhalbe ended, and Antichriſt ſhal not live, after he hath appeared and begun to reign, but three yeres &amp; a halfe. And the Pope hath reigned now with both ſwords in our adverſaries iudgement above 500. yeres, and yet the world dureth ſtil.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I truſt I have alreadie ſufficientlie manifeſted, that that firſt point, to weet, that <hi>the world ſhal end ſtraight after Antichriſts death,</hi> is not with anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petent reaſon by you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed; but that the ſcriptures alledged, doe ſpeak an other thing, farr diſtant from the laſt end. Then that the ſecond point alſo, viz. that Antichriſt shal live but 3 yeres and a halfe after he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to reign, is in the former chapter convinced to be moſt falſe: and to be nothing els but the efficacie of errour, to deceive them which beleeve not the truth, that at laſt they may perish in eternal deſtruction. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore that which you gather from theſe rotten foundations, viz. that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not yet come, and that the Pope of Rome is not he; is moſt vayn. Seing albeit the Pope hath reigned with both ſwords abov 500. yeres: yea and to yeild you more, hath fulfilled 1300. whole yeres: yet nothing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it him from being the Antichriſt; nay he is the more convinced by this to be the wicked man; as we hav shewed by undoubted reaſons, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <p>THE fourth cheif point comprehendeth two diſputations; one of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts proper name; another of his mark. His proper name, by all mens joint conſent, is gathered from that number chap. 13.18. <hi>And his number is 666.</hi> And this we have shewed in handling that place to be no other than <hi>Latinos,</hi> it being plainly confirmed by uſe, and the agreement
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:6819:286"/> of al things. And ſurely Irenaeus manie ages agoe, (whither led by conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or that he had ſo received from others, the auditors perhaps of the Apoſtles,) wrote that it was verie like to be this name. His words hereof are theſe; <hi>But the name Latinos alſo hath the number of 666. and it is very likely, becauſe the moſt true Kingdome hath this title. For the Latines are they that now reign, but of this we wil not boaſt.</hi> Thus writeth he. I confeſſe Irenaeus reſteth not in this name, but ſuppoſeth <hi>Titan</hi> to be more worthy of credit: yet his conjecture of the Latin Kingdome, came neerer the mark tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he weened. And becauſe you feel your ſelfe preſſed with his authoritie as with a great preiudice; you thought it beſt firſt to weaken that; and therfore <hi>his conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is at this day nothing, becauſe the Latines doo not ſo much reign, as the Turks, Spaniards, Frenchmen.</hi> I anſwer, this your inſtance is altogither nothing. For it is not needful that the Kingdome of which Antichriſt should ſpring, should alwayes be moſt mightie: but it is ynough if it have been ſo ſome long time; as the Latine was after Irenaeus for many ages. An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſts Kingdome shalbe weakned by litle and litle, before the abſolute and laſt waſting, until at length it be utterly ruinate. Wee have heard that <hi>Jezabel ſhould be caſt into a bed of languiſhment,</hi> chap. 2.22. And have yow not read afterwards that <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen:</hi> chap. 14.8. <hi>That the worſhipers of the Beaſt were made botchie; his throne darkned, that Antichriſt him ſelfe with his, ſhould gnaw their tongues for rage: chap. 16.2.10. Finall, that the Kings ſhould forſake the whore, make her naked, eat her fleſh, and at laſt burn her with fyre, chap. 17.16.</hi> Have you not, I ſay, read theſe things; and doo you require notwithſtanding that Antichriſts Kingdom should flouriſh unto the laſt moment of time, even as it did in former ages? Certainlie you take for defenſe, that which moſt of al killeth your cauſe. For unleſſe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Kingdome were fallen at laſt from the higheſt top unto this ſo low a ſtep, it ſhould not be Antichriſtian.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you obiect, that <hi>Latinos, for to ſignifie the Roman, is not written by a diphtong ei, but by ſimple i, &amp; then it makes not that number.</hi> I anſwer: Irenaeꝰ doubtleſſe knew the orthographie of the word, as wel as Bellarmine. He would never hav ſaid it was <hi>very likely,</hi> if ſo be the iuſt writing of it had diſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iuſt accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

                           </hi> ſaying that <hi>the firſt ſyllable is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the 2 greek vowels e &amp; i:</hi> could he not ſee what <hi>Latinos</hi> needed for the true orthographie? And wheras <hi>Latinos</hi> is at this day writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſingle <hi>i?</hi> you need not, I trow, betaught that lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>i</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced lik the diphto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g <hi>ei,</hi> &amp; had <hi>litle e</hi> included.

                        <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>Antichriſts name ſhould be proper unto him, and moſt uſual: for it muſt be ſhewed for a ſign of al that buy or ſell And no Pope was ever caled by this proper name Latinus, neither doo they commonly cal themſelves Latines, but onely Biſhops or Popes.</hi> I anſwer, Experience in deede dooth very wel ſatiſfy this argument. But, ſay you, <hi>Latinos</hi> is not the proper name of any Pope. Wel then, let ſome Frenchman or Spaniard, or German, or any other, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to himſelfe the name and authoritie, eyther of the Latine Pope, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Bishop, or Latine Patriarche; (for <hi>Latine</hi> is not a nown <hi>ſubſtantive,</hi> as they ſay, but an <hi>adiective,</hi> to which ſome thing muſt needs be ioyned;) the Bishop of Rome, I trow, wil be nothing angrie, who looſeth nothing by a common name. Or rather wil not the Antipapal warr be renewed: the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> curſing the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with al execrations, who shal challenge that which properly perteineth unto his ſeate? So farre therfore is it, that this name is not proper to anie Pope, as it is proper to al, for the time they hold the chaire: ſeing Antichriſt is a ſucceſsion of Bishops, not a ſingular perſon, as is shewed before. Neyther are Forenames &amp; Surnames onely proper; but whatſoever noteth out a thing plainly, diſtinctly, certainly, and truly, is to be counted a proper name. Vnleſſe perhaps you onely can not tell who is the Greek or Syrian or Aegyptian Patriarch, becauſe none was ever caled by theſe proper names? Againe, the ſame uſe may teach, how this name is shewed of al for a ſign. For let ther be ſome one of us, with yow Papiſts, and let him openly declare himſelfe to be an enemie of the Latine name, religion, Empire; shal he ſel anie thing among you, unleſſe it be his head? Or shal he buy anie other thing then a ſure gibbet? The Greeks are for a proof, of how great moment this name is; which could receive no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from theſe of the weſt, before they acknowledged this name, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jected themſelves to the Latine Pope: as we shewed before, chap. 13.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, you ſay, <hi>there are innumerable names which make this number.</hi> I anſwer, this name is not onelie to be iudged by the number, but alſo by al properties ioyned togither, which the Spirit hath fixed as railes, to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:6819:287"/> the greatnes of it. For ther muſt be ſuch a number of 666, as ſhould make a numerable and famous name, at that time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Propheſie was given to Iohn: which notwithſtanding for the Churches good was not then openly to be divulged, leaſt it should procure unneceſſarie peril: and finally, by which men which take the marke therof, are received unto mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual traffique. That this is the true and natural deſcription of this name, we have learned from Apoc. 13.18. as upon that place we shewed: &amp; now if al theſe properties doo agree to innumerable or manie names, let them be al of like account. But ſeing neither <hi>Teitan,</hi> nor <hi>Arnoumai,</hi> nor <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petes</hi> or other of like ſort; nor <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Luther,</hi> nor <hi>Dabhidh Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thraiu</hi> David Chitraeus, nor <hi>Saxoneios,</hi> or anie other like fiction can be fitly applyed unto that purpoſe: needs muſt Latinos, not onely for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the number, but for the agreement alſo of al the properties, be counted the onely and true name of Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>The laſt refuge and inſoluble argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is, <hi>that men doo yet ſtrive with great controverſie about this name: for if,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Antiehriſt were come, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome were he: his name would be certainly known: for al Propheſies whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are fulfilled, are made moſt certayn. Chriſts name noted of Siby lla by the number 888. was hidd from al, before his coming: but after he was come, al controverſie was taken away, and al men plainly know that he is caled Jeſus.</hi> I anſwer, that is falſe which you ſimply &amp; abſolutely doo avouch of the clearnes of Propheſies after they be fulfilled. The Propheſies in deed are clear, when they have their event, but unto them whom they concern, and whoſe eyes God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth: as for the unbeleevers and the other wicked multitude, they con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinue darke and obſcure unto them, no leſſe when they are fulfilled, than before. For why doo the Iewes deney Chriſt to be yet come, when ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages ſithens, the thing hath been performed? Why did they not ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge <hi>Elias</hi> in the perſon of the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as that of Malachie, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at him evidently with the finger? Ther is no doubt, but <hi>that abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deſolation</hi> which Daniel foretold, and Chriſt biddeth ſo diligently to be conſidered: was fulfilled in the deſtruction of Ieruſalem. But doo all even Chriſtians agree, what this <hi>abomination</hi> was? As for <hi>Sibyll,</hi> her Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtik verſes might have taught, what this name should be. Yet the Iewes doo neither beleev Sibyll, neither wil they have the name <hi>Ieſus</hi> fitlie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree unto that number. They ſtrive about the orthographie, (as you ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while did for yours;) they take away the laſt letter, writing the name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and maymed <hi>Jeſſu:</hi> or if they grant the letter <hi>Ain</hi> should be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therto, yet they ask by what reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Greek <hi>Sigma</hi> is put in the place therof; ſeing otherwhere it is wont to be expreſſed by <hi>A</hi> or by <hi>N.</hi> Doo
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:6819:288"/> you ſee then how vayn &amp; frivolous this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is? Doo you, for to prov that Antichriſt is not yet come, afford help to the Iewes; that withal you may evince, that Chriſt is not come neither? But it ſuteth wel, that Chriſt should be oppugned, &amp; Antichriſt defended, with the ſame arguments. You cannot, Bellarmine, whiles you ar environned with the thick ſmoke of the pit, behold with pure eyes the <hi>Angel of the bottomleſſe pit.</hi> You muſt goe forth into the wildernes with Iohn, from out of the vapour of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal cave: &amp; then wil al things appear unto you clearly.</p>

Moreover, is it ſtrange unto you that any multitude should be ſignified in the ſingular number, and contrariweiſe, one thing in the plural number? But <hi>the name and number of the name,</hi> you ſay, are <hi>ſingular things.</hi> Be it ſo; ſurely by like reaſon you might conclude that <hi>Muſraijn</hi> is of the form ſingular, becauſe <hi>Put</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> with which it is ioyned, ar of that form: Gen. 10.6. Who ever urged this, that al words should be of lik force, which ar rehearſed in any one ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? But, if Grammar perhaps wil not ſatiſfie you, yet Logike wil conſtrein you to reſt; which teacheth that a mark or character is one in the name, but manifold in the thing. For a mark is that which neceſſarily al muſt receiv, ver. 16. but it is neceſſary that al receiv, eyther the <hi>mark</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly ſo caled, or the <hi>name</hi> of the Beaſt, or the <hi>number</hi> of his name, ver, 16. Therfore theſe al ar <hi>marks;</hi> &amp; that which is univerſally caled a <hi>mark</hi> ver. 16 we now perceiv co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth moe kinds, &amp; that you falſly affirm the marke to be one.</p>
                        <pb n="561" facs="tcp:6819:288"/>
                        <p>Secondly, you obiect, that <hi>the mark is common to all: the oth of fealtie, and Preiſtly unction, is of few:</hi> I anſwer, the mark is twofold; the one general co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending in it al the other enſignes of the Beaſt: the other ſpecial, a part &amp; member of the former. For that which is firſt caled a <hi>mark,</hi> ver. 16. is diſtributed into three members, ver. 17. namely, into the <hi>mark,</hi> ſo caled by the name of the whole; the <hi>name</hi> of the Beaſt; &amp; the <hi>number</hi> of his name. Now then ſee how finely you reaſon. The mark is common to all: the oth of fealtie is not common to all: therfore it is not the mark. In the major, the <hi>mark</hi> is taken generally: but then nothing can be concluded therupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that the oth of fealtie, or preiſtly unction, &amp; ſuch like, is not the gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral marke: which I eaſily grant. Or if it ſignify a ſpecial mark; the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion is particular, and ſo the whole reaſon, is without reaſon. After the ſame manner one may prove that a man is not a ſenſible creature. For a se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſible creature is a thing common to al that have ſenſe; a man is not a thing common to al that have ſenſe; therfore, no ſenſible creature. Of all the flours of Logik, you ſeem moſt to delight in Aequivocations: which yow uſe ſo often, as if you reliſhed nothing, that is not ſeaſoned with this ſalt.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly you ſay, <hi>the mark may be caried indifferently in the right hand or in the forehead: but the oth, unction, profeſſion, &amp;c. belong not to theſe parts: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore ar not marks.</hi> I anſwer, by your ſport you make your ſelfe a ſport moſt of al. Surely no ſober man, when he ſeeth the mark to be caled by a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Speech, would require the places on which it is imprinted, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken in their natural ſignification. We read that <hi>the elect were ſealed on their foreheads,</hi> Chapt. 7.3. Think you ther was ſome very brand marke ſet on thoſe parts of their face? So Ezechiel ſaw the godly of Ieruſalem, <hi>ſigned on their foreheads:</hi> yet no man ever beleeved, that the men, <hi>(excepting in the type)</hi> wer painted with a verie ynken mark, Ezek. 9 4. The like borowed ſpeech is here of the forehead, &amp; hand, &amp; mark. The <hi>forehead</hi> is the bold &amp; open profeſsion: the <hi>hand</hi> is the ſtout and diligent labour: for the performance of both of theſe to the Biſhop of Rome, everie of his ſervitours according to the condition of his place, is bound by <hi>mark.</hi> Wherupon this mark is not ſeen onely in <hi>the knees,</hi> as you would prettily frump our men: but, that you maie the more marvel, even whiles your ſelfe in time paſt ware a cowl on your ſhoulders, you openly shewed by the mark on your forehead, whoſe beaſt you were.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, you ſay, <hi>in Antichriſts Kingdome no man ſhould be ſuffred to buy or ſell unleſſe he ſhewed the mark, or name, or number of his name: but many of the Popes dominion doo buy and ſell, which have not yeilded the oth of fealtie, yea in the Citie of Rome it ſelfe, as Iewes &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="562" facs="tcp:6819:289"/>
                        <p>I anſwer, the neceſsitie of the mark for mutual traffique, is required in the ſubiects onely; not in ſtrangers, ſuch as the Iewes are eſtemed. For who iudgeth them that are without? But if any that is caled a Chriſtian should shew his mind to be alienated from the Pope of Rome, he can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weiſe traffique among you, than by procuring to himſelfe the danger of his head; as we have shewed more at large Apoc. 13.17. The words ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the text, have not yet refuted theſe which you cal trifles: but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doo confirm them to contein one true meaning.</p>
                        <p>Your other reaſon is wherby you prove that <hi>al theſe ſignes are more ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t than Antichriſt.</hi> Which that it may the more diſtinctly be underſtood, we are to know, that Antichriſts time is two fold; (for this ſummarie diviſion is now ynough.) The one, of his firſt riſing, wherby he is <hi>the firſt Beaſt;</hi> the other, of his ſecond riſing after his head was healed, wherby he is <hi>the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Beaſt.</hi> Now the <hi>Mark</hi> is the ordinance of this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Beaſt, within whoſe borders it is conteyned, though the foundations were layd before: which began then to get it force, when the Romish ceremonies were obtruded on the Churches, and al were conſtreyned to undergoe the yoke of them. Wherupon that which you bring of certain rites, is altogither from the queſtion in hand. For the antiquitie of theſe rites is not now dealt with al; but the time when firſt they were uſed for a ſacrament of Romish obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: which you shal not find to be before the birth of the ſecond Beaſt, if you wil caſt a true account. For wheras in the firſt place you mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Chriſme of Baptiſme,</hi> we acknowledge the ſuperſtition therof to be ancient; yet Sylveſter the Roman, put to it ſome new thing, not neceſſarilie uſed in other Churches; til Auguſtine the Monk the Roman Apoſtle about the yere 600. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled the Brittans to adminiſter Baptiſm after the Romish manner, and to receiv the books of their other ceremonies. Con. Rom. 1. Can. 5. Innocent. 3. Decret. Epiſt. Beda Hiſtor. Angl. lib. 2. cap. 2. And this Mark once received, the age folowing alſo imprinted deeper, &amp; propagated larger through al Germanie by meanes of Boniface the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishman, who ſtablished the Romish rites everie where, and remooved out of their places manie godly and learned men, that ſomewhat reſiſted the ſame. What should I mention other countries, of which it is now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficientlie known to everie one, both by what beginnings and proceeding at laſt al were branded with the ſame marks?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the name <hi>Catholik,</hi> we confeſſe the Romish Church was in old time Catholik, (ſo farr as this nam ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agree to a particular Church) whiles integritie of doctrine flourished in the ſame: and therfore was not amiſſe by the ancient Fathers often ſo caled. I confeſſe alſo, the firſt decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:6819:289"/> of this Church not being wel perceived, and Auguſtine, Victor Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis, &amp; others ſpake honourably of this Church. But what is theſe mens commendation, to excuſe the Antichriſtian loftynes that folowed? It is one thing to be <hi>Catholick;</hi> another thing to be the <hi>onely Catholik.</hi> The firſt, holy men acknowledged becauſe of the conſent of holynes: this other, the later Popes chalenged as proper to their ſeate, after that they could ſuffer no man, except they had him bound unto them by ſome ſign of ſervitude. Then boaſted they impudently, <hi>that it was neceſſarie to ſalvation, to be ſubiect to the Church of Rome:</hi> Bonifac. 8. Extrav. de Majorit. &amp; obed. tit. Vni, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſanctam: and that <hi>he was an heretik, which denyed the authority and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of that ſeat:</hi> Nicolaus to the Bbs. of Millain, Diſtinct. 22. Omnes. Which verie thing you chant at this day to the world: but a thing never heard off before, til the Beaſt came foorth with his branding yron. You ar wont fooliſhly to skip, at this word <hi>Catholik</hi> ſo often as you meet with it, as if it were your peculiar enſigne: but bring forth anie one place of anie approved and ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t author, that made Rome a ſquare and rule of faith, ſo as your Popes ſacrilegiouſly arrogated to their ſeat, after the riſing of the ſecond Beaſt, namely after the yere of our Lord, about 600. And if you can not, then acknowledge eyther the <hi>Mark,</hi> or at leaſt your owne lamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table obſtinacie.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, you ſay, <hi>the oth of fealtie is found in the time of Gregorie,</hi> lib. 10. Epiſt. 31. I anſwer, miſerable is your want, Bellarmine; who were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to inſiſt in the firſt degree, before the riſing of the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Beaſt. Could nothing be produced more ancient, wherby you might put the thing out of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troverſie? But neither dooth this oth profit you any thing; ſeing it was not compelled, but willingly offred; nor of anie univerſal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der receiving authoritie to doo a thing, but of one ſchiſmatik asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and returning to the communion of Rome. Wherupon it was not the <hi>Mark,</hi> ſo much as a kind of reſemblance and image of it to come ſoon after. In creating of Biſhops, I find no oth more ancient than that of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface, about the yere 726. after that the ſecond Beaſt was riſen up. And in ordeining of the civil Magiſtrate, none before that of Otho the firſt, in the yere 912. Shew you ſomthing before, or confeſſe that this ſign, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in the chief force of the ſpecial mark is conteyned, came not abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecond Beaſt had brought it forth.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, you ſay, <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen mentioneth the anoynting of Preiſts.</hi> I anſwer, Nazianzen ſpeaketh not properly but figuratively. No writer of that age, makes mention of that ordinance of Anoynting. And Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t 3. takes away al ſcruple, who plainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth that the Greeks uſed not
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:6819:290"/> this manner of Anoyting in ordering Bishops, before his time. For ſo Decret. Epiſt. lib. tit. 15. he writeth to the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, of a certayn Branditribarenſe Biſhop, who in his conſecration had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy unction as he caleth it. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with you, Biſhops are not wont to be anoynted when they ar conſecrated: we have commanded that to be ſupplied in him, which he wanted, cauſing his head and hands to be oynted with the holy Chriſme, by the Biſhop of Alba, two Biſhops moe aſſiſting him, according to the Eccleſiaſtical manner.</hi> Wherupon afterward he exhorteth alſo the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch himſelfe, that he would likeweiſe be anoynted. <hi>We warn therfore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>your brotherhood, and diligently exhort, that you alſo receive the ſacred unction, that you maie want nothing to make up the ſacrament: and when you are anoynted with the holy Chriſme, that you likeweiſe anoynt your Archbiſhops and Biſhops: &amp; by them cauſe the hands of the Preiſts to be anoynted with the bleſſed oil: that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyning Preiſts and conſecrating Biſhops, you maie keepe and cauſe that manner to be kept, which the Apoſtolical ſeat obſerveth.</hi> Thus wrote he: By which it is manifeſt that neither Patriarch nor Archbishops nor Bishops nor Preiſts received any oincting in their ordination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> til the Romiſh mark came unto them. Which alſo might be underſtood by Nazianzens words, who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth no otherweiſe of the Preiſts oil, than of the uſe of the talents, of the care of the flock, and of the oil of perfection: which are all ſpoken figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, you bring forth, <hi>the ſacrifice for the dead, and the worſhipping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi> of the beginning of which impieties ther is no need curiouſly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. VVhoſoever was the author by whom firſt they tooke place, they became the ſymbols of Rome onely, after that she would have them exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by her onelie authoritie. For when she had bereft Leo Iſaurus of the Empire of the VVeſt, for being againſt her Idolatrie; ſhe made manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to all, both what her marke was, for which she ſo egerly contended, and with how great perill men did refuſe to receive the ſame. Of theſe ſignes therfor, ſome indeede are before the <hi>ſecond Beaſt,</hi> in the beginning of their ſuperſtition: but in force of binding to Rome, they be eyther al equal, or in age a litle after.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe to the former marks we have adioyned the numeral name <hi>Latinos;</hi> leaſt perhaps you ſhould here object the ſame thing which you doo in the other; I wil ſpeak of it a few words. This name is moſt ancient: who knowes it not? which notwithſtanding lay dead for many ages, til the Emperours tranſlated their ſeat to Conſtantinople. Then it ſomwhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and began to be famous; as appeareth by Epiphanius in his book De menſur. &amp; pond. ſpeaking of the Romans, <hi>which are not ſtil caled Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi>
                           <pb n="565" facs="tcp:6819:290"/> ſaith he, <hi>but Latines.</hi> But this name was not yet ſo commonly uſed, or ſo obtruded on the Churches, as to have the dignitie of a mark. VVherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Socrates, Theodoret, Sozomen, Evagtius, doo uſe the ſame very ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or no where rather, to my remembrance: but ſo often as they ſpeak of Rome, they cal it <hi>Old Rome,</hi> &amp; the Provinces they diſtinguiſh by the names of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> onely. But after when at length the ſecond Beaſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiled al things, and a partition of the Empire was made, &amp; limits were appointed, by Nicephorus of Conſtantinople, &amp; Charles the Great: then did the name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces remayn in the Eaſtern countries: &amp; the VVeſtern were by a common name caled <hi>Latin;</hi> as appeareth by Zona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Nicetas, Gregoras, and Chalchocondilas. Neither was it ynough thenceforward for the Greeks to ſubmitt themſelves unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch; (for they chalenged this name of <hi>Romans</hi> to themſelves;) but now the chieftie was to be yeelded unto the <hi>Latin Biſhop,</hi> or Bishop of <hi>Old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;</hi> or otherweiſe no reconciliation could be made, as appeareth by the Council of Lions, under Gregorie 10. However therfore theſe and many other ſuperſtitions were in uſe many yeres, before Antichriſt was known to the world: yet after they were made bonds to tye men for to defend the errours of the Church of Rome, then put they on the nature of <hi>Brands</hi> &amp; <hi>Marks.</hi> Theſe things doo you diſpute againſt the true <hi>Mark,</hi> ſtabliſhing rather our opinion by your empty oppugnation, than doing it the leaſt hurt. But what <hi>Mark</hi> doo your ſelfe now feign unto us? forſooth <hi>ſome poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv Mark which Antichriſt ſhould deviſe, but what it is, ſhal not be known until he come.</hi> I anſwer; if it be a poſitive mark, and al muſt receive it, as the Spirit evidently ſaith; then Antichriſt muſt eyther goe to all, or at leaſt muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell al to come to him. VVhither of the two we make it, here wil come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that admirable journey into al lands in his three yeres ſpace &amp; a litle more; of which we ſpake in the 6. chapter of this Refutation, againſt the <hi>publik perſecution.</hi> Or though the performance hereof be committed to his Legats: ther wil, I beleev, be more travel and buſynes, than can be diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in ſo litle a ſpace.</p>

                        <p>TOVCHING the generation and ſtock of Antichriſt, you rehearſe the opinions of certain Fathers; <hi>ſome of which,</hi> you ſay, <hi>are erroneous, ſome probable, otherſome ſure and certayn. Erroneous are the opinions of the Author of the treatiſe of Antichriſt, among the works of Auguſtine, of Hippolitus Martyr, of Origen and Sulpitius. Probable, are thoſe of Damaſcen, Irenaeus, Hippolitus, Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>broſe,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:6819:291"/> Auguſtine, Proſper, Theodoret, Gregore, Bede, Rupertus, Aretas, Richard and Anſelmus.</hi> The catalogue of whom I now therfore repeat, to put you in mind, upon what authors you rely in this matter. For when you ſee theſe whom you eſteem for chief witneſſes in al queſtions, partly to be in manifeſt error, partly to confirm their opinion with no ſure arguments: why doo you wholly depend, I pray you, upon their words, as it wree u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſome divine oracle, that could not be deceived? It is no wiſe mans part willingly to folow blind guides, eſpecially ſuch as himſelfe ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be blind. Awake then at laſt, and learn to know Antichrſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the truth it ſelfe, than from them which have ſcarcely ſeen anie shadowing pourtraiture of him. But to let theſe paſſe, let us come to thoſe things which you count moſt certayn; of which the one is, that <hi>Antichriſt ſhal chiefly come for the Jewes, and be received of them as the Meſſias.</hi> The other, that <hi>he ſhalbe borne of the Jewes ſtock, and be circumciſed, and obſerve the Sabbath, at leaſt for a time.</hi> Both which, the time of Antichriſts coming teacheth to be moſt falſe. For ſeing he hath reigned now manie ages at Rome, to weet ſince the hethen Emperours were expelled; and yet the Iwes ſubmitt not-unto him: it neceſſarilie foloweth, that he neither is to be received of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Meſsias, neither shal he come chiefly for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea neither was he to be as appeareth by the teſtimonie of al memorie paſt, which never rela<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth any Iew to have ſitten in the chaire of the Pope of Rome, and it is in ſome ſort certayn that ther never ſhal. For he shal not invade by open for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and bring in a new regiment. For ſo he should not be the <hi>ſeventh head,</hi> or the <hi>eight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> which is the ſame; but the <hi>ninth;</hi> wheras ſo manie heads the Beaſt hath not. And it is not likely, conſidering the ſagenes of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, eſpecially being holpen by the Porphyrie ſeat, that ever they willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wil chooſe ſuch a one, whiles things remayn as they are. Al theſe your trifles fal to the ground, by thoſe engins which the Spirit miniſtreth, and we applyed in the beginning of this treatiſe. But let us examine what you bring to the contrarie. Firſt you confirm that <hi>Antichriſt ſhal come ciefly for the Iewes, and ſhalbe received of them as the Meſſias, from the place often cited; J am come in my Fathers name, and ye receive me not: if an other come in his owne name, him ye wil receive:</hi> Iohn 5.43. I anſwer, it is true, that an Antichriſt ſhould be received of the Iewes; but the queſtion is of the Antichriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo caled, not taken commonly. The proper Antichriſt they would never acknowledge, as is moſt ſure by manie arguments, which may be gathered from the things fore ſpoken: the other they would readily and ſtudiouſly folow: as came to paſſe as we read in Seder Olam Zuta of one Cuziba, and a certayn Syrian mentioned by Paulus Diaconus, lib. 21.
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:6819:291"/> rerum Rom.; and elſwhere of other ſuch like deceivers, which vaunted themſelves to be the Meſsias. That therfore which is ſpoken of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts of the Iewes, is wrongly wreſted to the great Antichriſt, whom the Apocalypſe and Apoſtles doo deſcribe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you bring that in 2 Theſſ. 2.10. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, therfore God wil ſend them the operation of errour, that they may belpev lyes &amp;c. This place,</hi> you ſay, <hi>the ancient Interpre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters doo expound of the Iewes:</hi> I anſwer, as touching the ancient Interpreters, you know their mind being poſſeſſed with ſome preiudice, inclined all their cogitations therunto. Wherupon it came to paſſe that thoſe holy men, when once they had conceived in mind, that Antichriſt ſhould be a Iew, taking it ſo rather one from another than weighing the thing it ſelf: whatſoever anie where was delivered about this matter, they applyed for the moſt part therunto. But, ſay you, the thing it ſelf without the Fathers commentaries proclaymeth that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Iewes. This in deede is worthy to be conſidered, for from hence we shal have wherby we may judge of thoſe Fathers teſtimonie. Firſt therfore you ſay, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould be ſent unto them which would not receive Chriſt. And who are they which more ought and would not receiv Chriſt, than the Jewes?</hi> I anſwer, rhat which you firſt propound, is not firm ynough. For the Apoſtle ſaith not that Antichriſt ſhould be ſent unto them <hi>which would not receive Chriſt,</hi> but, <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth.</hi> And ther is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two; as much ſurely as is between Iewes &amp; Gentiles. For this manner of ſpeaking which the Apoſtle uſeth, properly belongeth to the Gentils, who ſhal bring, as he ſaith, this evil upon themſelves; not for that they altogither refuſed the truth, but becauſe outwardly profeſsing it, they cary not that ſtudie, zele, deſire towards it, that was meet. Even as the Angel of Epheſus is blamed, (&amp; that in the name of the whole Church of the Gentiles, as there we shewed,) for that he had left his firſt love; Ap. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4. From theſe words therfore I conclude moſt firmly againſt you, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them which acknowledging &amp; profeſsing the truth, did not love the ſame as became them, which agreeth certes to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles onely, not to the Iewes: who refuſing the whole truth, are not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for want of love: ſeing the leſſer crime is not wont to be obiected, &amp; nothing ſaid of the greater. Secondly you ſay, <hi>the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not in the time to come, they wil not receive: but in the time paſt, they have not received: which agreeth to the Iewes that would not beleeve when Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached; when in the mean while the Gentiles received the Goſpel moſt deſirouſly.</hi> I anſwer, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in reſpect of the time of Antichriſt, of whom he trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth.
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:6819:292"/> God wil ſend Antichriſt, becauſe before Antichriſt came, men ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ouſly folowed not the truth, as became them. Neither could he ſpeake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therweiſe, unleſſe he had ſet the punishment before the offenſe. For if he had ſayd, <hi>becauſe they wil not receive the truth,</hi> it might ſeem that Antichriſt should come upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the obſtinacie that should be after his coming. Theſe ar your reaſons, which you ſay, doo proclaym that the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth of the Iewes: but if you diligently mark, you wil confeſſe that this is not ſo much as a ſoft whiſpering, unto the lowd crie on the other part. For hear what the Apoſtle ſaith in the beginning of the chapter, ver. 3. <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ther come a departure firſt, and the man of ſin be reveled &amp;c.</hi> Wherby he tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth that the <hi>departure,</hi> (or <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi>) shal goe before Antichriſt; and the Revelation of Antichriſt, before the coming of the Lord. And whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture shal this be? not the Iewes: for they received not the truth at all. And defection is from a thing, which one embraced before. Moreover theſe mens defection could not be to come, ſeing they from the firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the faith, did reſiſt the truth. Therfore it should be the defection of the Gentiles; and not paſſed, but to come. For if it had been paſt, the Theſſalonians had ſeen Antichriſt, who had not yet shewed himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtreyned by ſome impediment, as the Apoſtle after teacheth. But you wil ſay, <hi>this departure was from the Roman Empire.</hi> But let the Apoſtle, I pray you, interpret himſelfe, who afterwards expreſſeth that which here he caleth <hi>a departure,</hi> by other words, <hi>for that they received not the love of the truth,</hi> ver. 10. And what other departure, could bring forth this miſchee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous evil? Was the Roman Empire which crucified the Son of God, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garded of God, as for departure from it, he would ſend Antichriſt into the world? Theſe are the dreams of Romish men that abound with exceſſ and ſurfetting: not of ſuch as with true deſire doo folow the truth. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever hitherto you have ſaid, it is clear ynough, that they be not Iewes which should receive this Antichriſt, but Gentiles: and that for iuſt cauſes, Calvin of bleſſed memorie, and others whom yoy cal Heretiks, did depart from the ancient Fathers interpretation; &amp; alſo did expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d theſe things of you and ſuch like, from whom certaynly, ſo farr as it ſeemeth, God hath taken away al iudgement of right and wrong in matters of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; becauſe you more eſteme the honour and pleaſures of this world, than the ſimplicitie of the Goſpel. But, by reaſon alſo you would perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <hi>that the Jewes are they which ſhal receive Antichriſt, who ſhould joyn himſelfe firſt unto them. For they be ready to receav him, which expect the Meſſias to be a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral King.</hi> I anſwer, they are readie in deed to receive Antichriſts, and oft-times they have received them, according to that which Chriſt foretold:
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:6819:292"/> but what is this unto the Antichriſt, of whom we ſpeak? For inquiſition is made of Antichriſt properlie ſo caled, who becauſe he hath <hi>two horns like the Lamb,</hi> Apoc. 13.11. they which hate the Lamb, doo hate him alſo that is ſomewhat like him. and therfore eſchew him as much as they can. Let the Iewes therfore cal the Pope of Rome <hi>Heghmon,</hi> that is <hi>tail,</hi> and give him what reprochful names ſo ever: yet foloweth it not therupon, that he is not the great Antichriſt, ſeing it is no where ſaid that he should be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by this people, in anie peculiar ſort. For wheras you ſay Antichriſt shal in like manner come from the Iewes to the Gentiles, as Chriſt came from the Iewes to the Gentiles: ſurely you either gheſſe or dream. Yow prove nothing, unleſſe perhaps you would make Chriſt to be a tipe of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt; which impious divinitie of yours we heard once before, in the ch. of <hi>Antichriſts durance.</hi> That which you bring therfore of Antichriſt proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſo caled, to be received of the Iewes, is altogither vayn. The ſecond, which you ſaid was alſo moſt certayn, is <hi>that Antichriſt ſhalbe a Jew, and circumciſed: and this,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is deduced from the things foreſpoken:</hi> I anſwer, thoſe things alreadie ſpoken from which this is deduced, we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently shewed to be moſt abſurd: and therfore this which is builded upon them, is of like ſtrength and authoritie. For that which you annex in ſted of confirmation, <hi>that the Iewes wil never receive a man that is not a Jew, and un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>circumciſed:</hi> it makes againſt you. For hence it foloweth that they wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive Antichriſt properlie ſo caled, whom by neceſſarie reaſons wee have evinced to be a Gentile and uncircumciſed.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, you ſay, <hi>Antichriſt feynenth himſelfe to be of Davids familie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a one the Jewes doo expect;</hi> I anſwer, either Antichriſt shal fein it, or you now feyn it of him. VVhere, I pray you, dooth the holy Ghoſt, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g al other notes of the true Antichriſt, deſcribe him unto us by this? But it is Gods juſt iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that you which turn the truth into shadows should be deluded by shadowes in ſtead of the truth. And ſo as your cuſtome is, being deſtitute of al ſcripture and probable reaſon, you flee to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of humane authoritie: wherunto, beſides the other things alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fore mentioned, I oppoſe this reaſon in ſted of a concluſion. The Iewes shal have no dominion, before they return unto Chriſt: and therfore the Antichriſt shal not be of them; who should be the higheſt ruler, and as you feighn, by help of the Iewes should ſubdue the Gentils. The firſt part of the reaſon is plainly confirmed by manie ſcriptures: ſome of which I wil ſet down, not ſo much for your ſake Bellarmine, (though for yours al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo, if ſo be at laſt you shal affect the truth;) as for my brethrens: whom I would have to be ſtirred up by this iudgment, unto a more diligent ſerch

Where the laſt plague of the chapter, is this greevous caſting of of the Iewish nation, in which they lye for deſpiſing Chriſt, from the time he was crucified unto this verie day: whoſe ſolution and deliverance at laſt, is conjowned with the extreme miſerie wherin they shalbe, at the time when this deliverance shal happen unto them. But if that Antichriſtian glorie, which you doo feyn, doo come between: how shal this bounteouſnes of God, finde them ſo miſerably afflicted? The ſecond is out of that excellent ſong of Moſes, Deut. 32.36. &amp;c. <hi>When the Lord ſhal have judged his people, then wil he repent towards his ſervants, when he ſhal ſee that their power is gone, and that the ſhut up with the left abroad is nothing: and he wil ſay, wher are their Gods? the Rock in whom they truſted?</hi> There Moſes ſingeth of the ſame times, &amp; t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Which few places may ſuffice to open the meaning of many. From which I conclude although the Bishop of Rome be neither at any time a Iew, nor by the Iewes received for the Meſsias, but rather be by them hated: yet this is no cauſe why he should not be the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; yea and unleſſe theſe things were, he should be farr from being the principal Antichriſt, as in their places we have declared.</p>

                        <head>Chapt. 13. Of Antichriſts ſeat.</head>
                        <p>IN expounding the words of the Propheſie, we concluded by moſt firm arguments taken therfrom, that <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſeat of Antichriſt; and that forthwith, after the Empire is taken from the Hethen Emperours. For the heads of the Beaſt, abide fixed to Rome, where are both thoſe <hi>Hills and Kings</hi> that the Angel ſpeaketh of. And wher theſe heads abide fixed; there muſt the ſeat of Antichriſt needs be. Moreover ſeing Antichriſt then alſo shewed himſelfe, when Conſtantine began to reign, as before is proved at large: he hath no other ſeat than <hi>Rome.</hi> For wheras he abode a few yeres at <hi>Avenion:</hi> he did that with purpoſe to ſojourn for a time, not with a mind to change his ſeat.</p>
                        <p>But on the contrarie, you Bellarmine doo contend, that Antichriſts ſeat shalbe <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not Rome: and <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> and <hi>Davids Throne:</hi> not S. Peters Temple, or the ſeat Apoſtolical. Which you endevour to prove two wayes: <hi>Firſt, by an argument unto the man; then, by the Scriptures and Fathers.</hi>
                           <pb n="571" facs="tcp:6819:293"/> The argument is this: <hi>If the Pope of Rome be Antichriſt, ſitting in the Church of Chriſt: then the Lutherans and Calviniſts, and as manie as are aliens from the Church which is under the Pope, doo live out of the true Church of Chriſt. For Chriſts Church can be but one, as Chriſt is one. And our men doo affirm the Pope of Rome to be Antichriſt: therfore our men all doo live out of the Church.</hi> I anſwer, the Propoſition is falſe, and relyeth onely upon the Churches <hi>unitie</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood. For the Church is both commonly ſo caled, and properly. The firſt, hath pietie corrupted; the word adulterated; the Sacraments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved; is ful of ſuperſtition, and humane deviſes, reteyning Chriſts name onely, and boaſting in the title therof: and alſo commonly ſo accounted, whiles any whit of the foundation is remaining. The other is chaſt, pure, entire, clean, hearkning to Chriſts voice in al things, and not departing from his praeſcribed rule any whit at all, ſo farr as mortal infirmitie ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; and this alwayes is the onely and true ſpouſe of Chriſt: how ever the whore alſo taketh this name to her ſelfe. So before, the <hi>Temple</hi> &amp; <hi>Altar</hi> was proper to the elect, and meſured by the Angel: but the <hi>Court</hi> was not ſet forth with any deſcription, but caſt out, and permitted to the Gentils, to weet, the prophane multitude, which for their neernes, falſly chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the name of the Temple. To whom the holy city alſo was given; which having their ſeat in the ſayd court, they trode under foot at their pleaſure, during the appointed time. Apoc. 11.1.2. More plainly in the 7. Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which all ar Chriſts, though <hi>Sardis</hi> lived but in name onely: and the Angel of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was neither hot nor cold, forthwith to be ſpued out, un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſe he repented. chap. 3.1.16. Therfore that is not rightly transferred unto the common Church, which perteineth unto it properly ſo caled. One may be an alien from the Church commonly ſo caled: and yet be a true citizen of the true Church. If you could shew that the Pope of Rome hath his chair in this, which properly inioyeth this name: you might right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly conclude us all to be fugitives and very miſerable. But whiles you ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle togither things disjoined, and contrarie; and dally, as your manner is, with a playn aequivocation; the abſurditie which you thought to throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, is lighted upon your own head. So your argument unto the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is lying, like him, whoſe cauſe you have in hand.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you prove it from three Scriptures, the firſt wherof is Apoc. 11.8. <hi>where,</hi> you ſay, <hi>John ſaith that Henoch and Elias ſhal fight with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt in Ieruſalem, and there be killed.</hi> I anſwer, that which is ſpoken of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch and Elias to come. and fight with Antichriſt, is altogither vain; as I have proved in the 6. chapter, againſt your third Demonſtration. But be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe it skilleth nothing, for the force of this argument, what the names
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:6819:294"/> of theſe Prophets be: we let that paſſe for the preſent, and doo ſay, that that which you tell us how they are to be killed in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is falſe. For the Spirit deſigneth not Ieruſalem by name, but onely by this circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, <hi>where our Lord was crucified:</hi> which agreeth as wel unto Rome, ſeing Chriſt was crucified by the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Pilate the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deputie. By which fact, he made his Citie guilty of this bloud, which was ſhed by this cities authoritie; as we have shewed on chap. 11.8. This argument therfore is worthleſſe and weak, aſſuming that which cannot be proved, yea the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary wherof is plainly evident by the Scriptures. Neither was ther anie cauſe, why either Chytraeus ſhould purpoſely paſſe by theſe words, as you feyn, <hi>where the Lord alſo was crucified;</hi> or why you should ſo trouble your ſelfe, to prove againſt Ierom, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> may be caled <hi>Sodome:</hi> which we acknowledge to be ſo caled otherwhere. Although in the Apocalypſe your <hi>Rome</hi> onely is <hi>Sodom;</hi> &amp; you ſhould rather have ſtreyned your ſinewes to acquitt your ſelves of this than have ſpent your ſtrength in a matter for which ther is no fight. The ſecond place is Apoc. 17. where Iohn ſaith, <hi>that the ten Kings which ſhal divide the Roman Empire to themſelves, and in the time of whoſe reign Antichriſt ſhould come, ſhal hate the purpled whore, that is, Rome, and make her deſolate, and burn her cke with fire. How then,</hi> ſay you, <hi>ſhall it be Antichriſts ſeat, if at the ſelf ſame time it muſt be overthrown and burnt?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Apocalypſe eaſily taketh from you this ſcruple. You ask, how Antichriſts ſeate can be burnt, he being alive and ſeing it. The Apocalypſe telleth, that the fift vial ſhalbe powred out on the Beaſts throne, and his kingdome shalbe made dark, ſo that they shal gnaw their tongues for ſo row, chap. 16.10.11. which <hi>vial</hi> verily, is no other thing, than this bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, wherby the ten Kings shal conſume the whore to ashes. For you ſee that this citie which is to be conſumed with fire, is Queen of the nations; which agreeth not to Ieruſalem, that hath been laid even with the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d now manie ages ſince. And if you doubt how the ten Kings should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with ſuch hatred, who ſo dearly loved the whore before: hear how the Angel ſaith, that for a time they would yeild themſelves wholly to the Beaſt, but should at length be ſtirred up of God to deſtroy her, whom they moſt honoured before, ver. 16.17. This hatred therfore, wil afford your Rome no comfort. The other things which you heap up to exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this argument, are of no weight at all. For that Antichriſt the Iewe, we have chaſed away in the former diſputation: and thoſe things that are mentioned of the Kingdome of Aſia, are ſome ſmal peeces of truth, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning clearly in the fabulous heap of confuſe earth. Certayn it is that the Empire shal return thither again; but which Antichriſt shal not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:6819:294"/> but Chriſt himſelfe shal build, taking pitie on his people, and decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring himſelfe in his Church, to be King of al nations.</p>
                        <p>The third place is in thoſe words, <hi>ſo that he ſitteth in the Temple of God:</hi> 2. Theſſ. 2.4. wher you bring four expoſitions of the <hi>Temple. The firſt is theirs that by the Temple, underſtand the minds of the faithfull. The ſecond is Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guſtines, who interpreteth the Temple to be Antichriſt himſelfe, with his whole peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, which wil have himſelfe and his, to be thought the true ſpiritual Temple of God. The third is Chryſoſtoms, that takes the Temple for Chriſtian Churches. The fourth is theirs that underſtand it of Salomons Temple.</hi> Of theſe four expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s you choſe this laſt, worſt, and furtheſt from the truth: even as women when they ar troubled with the green ſicknes, doo long for coles &amp; lether more then for wholſome meats. The <hi>Temple</hi> in this place, muſt needs be that peoples, whoſe the <hi>apoſtaſie</hi> is, for which Antichriſt is ſent: and this we have shewed to be the Gentiles onely, which came in deede unto Chriſt, but ſerved him not with ſuch affection as was meet: and that it can not by anie means agree to the Iewes, who never would be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> citizens of this Kingdome. Moreover, neither did Antichriſt come, while the old Temple ſtood; neither shal he ſit therin afterwards, ſeing it was overthrown long ſince, never to be reedified more, as the Angel teacheth, <hi>And the deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal continue even to the conſummation and end.</hi> Dan. 9.27. Beſides, how could the Apoſtle cal that <hi>Gods temple,</hi> which God would deteſt, and which shal not be founded by anie authoritie of his, but by Antichriſts commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone; as you wil have it, vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting himſelfe for the onely God? Theſe and many other things doo teach, that it is leaſt of al to be underſtood of Salomons Temple. Yet you ſay, <hi>this opinion is the more common, probable and learned.</hi> But by what reaſon, I pray you? <hi>Beeauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>in the Scripture of the New Teſtament, by the Temple of God, is never meant the Chriſtian Churches, but alwayes the temple of Jeruſalem.</hi> VVhich short ſentence conteineth two notable falshoods. The firſt is, that you ſay, by the temple of God, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant in the Apoſtles writings, the Chriſtian Churches. For, Paul in Epheſ. 2.21.22. ſpeaketh thus of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Jn whom al the building fitly coupled togither, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye alſo are built togither, to be the habitation of God by the Spirit.</hi> And what other thing dooth the Apocalypſe mean by that ſo often name of the <hi>temple:</hi> but the holy Chriſtian aſſemblies? <hi>Ariſe and meaſure the temple of God,</hi> chap. 11.1. <hi>Then was the temple of God opened,</hi> chap. 11.9. <hi>And they came out of the temple: neither could any enter into temple,</hi> chap. 15.6.8. The temple of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was deſtroyed, before this Revelation was made: leaſt perhaps yow should think, that that is meant by theſe words. This is the firſt falshood.
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:6819:295"/> The ſecond is, wher you ſay, <hi>the temple of God evermore ſignifieth the temple of Jeruſalem, in the new teſtament.</hi> For what? Are ther ſo manie Ieruſalem tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as ther are faithful perſons? Vnto the Corinthians Paul ſpeaketh in words commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to everie Chriſtian, <hi>Know you not that ye are the temple of God? And if anie deſtroy the temple of God &amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16.17. <hi>Know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. To let paſſe the things I mentioned a litle before. You certes are a more ſpeedy builder than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, which can build ſo manie temples in ſo short a ſpace: but what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not you doo, which make a Chriſt everie day of Bread? But this is a ſmal matter, you ſay, that the Scriptures doo ſo ſpeak. Therfore you bring ſome greater thing, namely that the ancient Fathers Latin and Greek, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ages, never caled the Churches of Chriſtians, <hi>temples;</hi> but Oratories, the Kings-houſes, or howſes of Martyrs. I anſwer, the ancient Fathers both Greek and Latine, did ſpeak ſo as the Scripture ſpeaketh: as Cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Alexand. Strom. lib. 7. <hi>One temple,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is great, as the Church: an other litle, as the man, who reteyneth Abrahams ſeed.</hi> And Cyprian in his firſt book againſt the Iewes, chap. 15. <hi>that Chriſt was to be the houſe and temple of God, and he had ended the old temple, &amp; begun a new.</hi> And lib. 5. Epiſt. 8. <hi>Although love ſhould no leſſe enforce us to help our brethren, yet it was to be conſidered in this place, that they are the temples of God which are taken; and that we ought not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by long delay and neglect of ſorow, the temples of God to be holden captives long.</hi> But, you wil ſay, that you mean not either Chriſtian aſſemblies, or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular faithful perſons, but howſes and aedifices wherin they meet togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for publik worship. I anſwer, you diſpute therfore bravely, who now conclude not the queſtion. For thus you reaſon. No howſes of publik worship were caled <hi>temples</hi> among Chriſtians for many ages: but ſome te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are howſes of publik worship; therfore ſome temple was not among Chriſtians for many ages. And what then, I pray you? For though ſome temple was not, yet ſome temple was among Chriſtians alſo in theſe ages you mention; even ſuch a temple as Antichriſt afterward should ſit in. Vnleſſe perhaps you think that holy howſes onely are temples: which if it be ſo, then Antichriſt shalbe no longuer Antichriſt, than he shal ſit in theſe material howſes: or if ſo he shalbe out of the holy howſes alſo, the great Antichriſt may alſo be out of the temple of God, and thouh he doo not shew himſelf as if he were God. For this ſacrilegious vaunting of him ſelfe, shalbe onely whiles he ſitteth in the temple of God, as is evident by the Apoſtles words. And ſo we shal have a new great Antichriſt, ſuch as the Apoſtles never ſaw by the Spirit of Propheſie. Great is the force of your argumentations, which everie where bring forth ſuch monſters: but
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:6819:295"/> let us goe forward. Wheras you ſay, <hi>that the howſes of prayer had not the name of temple given unto them, til Ieroms time,</hi> whom you cite: you may underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Euſebius who was before Ieroms age, abſteyned not from this name lib. Hiſt. 10. c. 2. whom Ruffinus maketh to ſpeak thus, lib. 9, Hiſt. Eccl. cap. 10. <hi>Renewed places by building to riſe up more high and excellent, and high te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to be lifted up, for the low meeting howſes,</hi> And again Euſeb. lib. 10. cap. 13. <hi>by whoſe induſtrie a ſumptuous temple was builded in Tyrus, the moſt famous throughout al the nation of Phaenicia.</hi> So alſo in a publick oration which one made of the building of Churches, aſcribed to Paulinus Bishop of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rians, <hi>And thou ô great praiſe of the new holy temple of God;</hi> and afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>he conſtituted this maieſtical temple of the moſt high God.</hi> And certainly the Spirit moſt wiſely meeting with your fraud, would have the name of <hi>temple,</hi> about that time when Antichriſt should appear, to be given even to the holy Chriſtian aedifices: that every way it might be evident how he ſitteth in the Temple of God. Wheras therfore concluding this point you ſay, <hi>it ſemeth certayn that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Jeruſalems temple; that writing how Antichriſt should ſit in the temple of God, he would ſay ſomthing which he would have underſtood by them to whom he wrote, and they then would underſtand and well perceive the name of the temple, nothing but the temple of Ieruſalem:</hi> you may eaſily now ſee how falſe it is, that I ſay no more, though I ſpeak tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Theſſalonians might underſtand that he should ſit in the minds and conſcience of men, whom he should ſeduce by his guile and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, as Anſelmus dooth interpret it; or that he should reign in Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſſemblies, as Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Theophilact &amp; Oecumenius doo expound it: or that he should boaſt himſelfe to be the temple &amp; Church, as Auguſtine explaineth it: But Ieruſalems temple could not come into their mind, which they knew by Chriſts words should utterly be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Mat. 23.39. &amp;. 2. and never be builded agayn, ſeing <hi>wrath was come upon the Jewes even to the utmoſt,</hi> as 1 Theſ. 2.16.</p>
                        <p>Vnto theſe you adjoin, as you ſpeak, <hi>the common expoſition of the Fathers;</hi> but the contrarie iudgment of thoſe before mentioned, wil not ſuffer it to be <hi>common:</hi> neither ought the ignorance of a few, to hurt the clear truth. Thus have we ſeen your arguments, whoſe force I now leave to be iudged by the reader: and in a word I wil conſider thoſe your anſwers, wherby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain you indevour to put away the reaſons of ſome of our ſide. Firſt, wher our men doo obiect from Apoc. 17. <hi>that the chief ſeat of Antichriſt is Rome; becauſe this ſeat is the great citie, which ſitteth upon 7. hills, and which hath reigne over the Kings of the earth, al which ar found in Rome;</hi> You anſwer three wayes. <hi>Firſt that by this citie is not meant Rome, but the univerſal citie of the Divil.</hi> But in this anſwer you reſt not, neither is it in deed of anie moment, ſeing it is
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:6819:296"/> not the univerſal citie of the Divil, which shalbe <hi>burned by the ten Kings,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the wicked remaining alive, which ſhal lament her fall, Apoc. 18.9. For how shal the whole citie perish, whoſe citizens ſhal afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn? Leaving therfore this, you betake you to an other, and you <hi>grant that by the whore is meant Rome, but hetheniſh Rome reigning, worſhiping Jdols, &amp; perſecuting Chriſtians: but not Chriſtian Rome.</hi> I anſwer, you doo evil disjoin, what the Spirit hath coupled. For Rome is then the whore and ſeat of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt, when it is caried of the Beaſt: and it was not caried of the Beaſt whiles the Hethens reigned. For it is caried of the ſeventh head, which was not yet come, when Iohn received this Propheſie: Apoc. 17.9.10. Moreover, if Hethenish Rome reigning, be the whore: then Antichriſt came during that Hethenish Empire. For the Spirit would have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe two to be undevided companions, until the burning of the whore. The Beaſt caried; the whore ſitteh: neither of them hath vital life without the other. Again, if that be true, now ſhe hath plainly left to be the whore, nor ſhould she be found ſuch, when Antichriſt should come; becauſe as afterward you tell us, <hi>Peters chaire cannot be ſeparated from Rome,</hi> lib. 4. de Rom. Pon. cap. 4. And how agreeth this, I pray you, that Rome being Chriſtian, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Catholik, Peters chair, as you wil have her; should at laſt ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of a whore; which when she was Hethenish, and according to your opinion, played the whore moſt lavishly, bare no punishment for it? Apoc. 17.16. Surely Ierom ſeemeth not wel to have affirmed, ſpeaking to Rome, <hi>I ſpeak unto thee, which by confeſſing of Chriſt, haſt wiped out the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie written on thy forehead,</hi> lib. 2. contra Iovinian. For Rome hath not wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away her blaſphemie, but imprinted it deeper after she became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſeing now she shal bear the punisment of her fornication. Your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſond anſwer therfore, is no leſſe infirm than the firſt. Let us ſee the third. And this ſaith, <hi>Although that woman were Chriſtian Rome, yet our argument ſhould have no force at al: becauſe Antichriſt ſhal hate Rome, &amp; fight with her, and make her d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ſolate, &amp; burn her. Therfore Rome is not Antichriſts ſeat.</hi> I anſwer, that which you ſpeak of Antichriſts hatred, &amp; fight againſt Rome, is plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly falſe. You borow this from Ap. 17.16. wher you read thus; <hi>and the ten horns which thou ſaweſt, &amp; the Beaſt, theſe ſhal hate the whore &amp;c.</hi> which reading we hav proved, in handling that place, to be faultie. The true reading is, <hi>&amp; the ten horns which thou ſaweſt on the Beaſt, theſe ſhal hate &amp;c.</hi> The difference is, that the true reading teacheth, that <hi>onely the horns of the Beaſt, ſhal hate the whore;</hi> the falſe would hav it, <hi>that both the horns, &amp; the Beaſt,</hi> that is, both the Kings &amp; Antichr. should hate the whore. Aretas readeth ſo as I ſay; the Vulg. Latine, (to which you ar bound by the decree of Trent,) hath it alſo;
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:6819:296"/> manie other copies have it ſo, to which the reſt of the Apocalypſe giveth approbation, moſt adverſe to that which you bring. Whetfore unleſſ you can find a better anſwer, you muſt needs confeſſe that Chriſtian Rome is the ſeat of Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>Vnto the ſecond place which our men bring, from 2 Theſ. 2.4 <hi>that An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhal ſit in the temple of God;</hi> you anſwer, <hi>that Paul ſpeaks of Solomons tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple: and you referr us to the things that you ſaid before:</hi> and ſo doo I the the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the refutation of them.

                              <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple might have bin the temple of Chriſtians, and ſo in deede was, whiles it remained, for the Apoſtles preached and prayed in it.</hi> Luk 24.53. Act. 3.1. and 5.20. I anſwer, and ask, what all theſe things doo make to confirm the ſitting of your Antichriſt, in Solomons Temple? Becauſe the Temple of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem wherin the Apoſtles preached and prayed, was whiles it continued, the Temple of God: shal therfore the Temple of God wherin Antichriſt shal ſit, be the Temple of Ieruſalem? Surely I could shew you, how after the old ordinances of religion were abrogated, a titular ſanctitie at leaſt might remayn for a time in that temple of Solomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a boat dooth not by and by ceaſe to move, after the oars be ſtayed: if it were not vain to ſpend labour in a thing of no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For you might with as much certaintie conclude, that the temple of God wherin Antichriſt shal ſit, is Ieruſalems temple, becauſe (with a litle change of the Poets words) <hi>Yee freinds, admitted auditours, can yee forbear to laugh?</hi> as from the antecedent which you have ſet down.</p>
                        <p>Vnto that of Daniel chap. 9. <hi>And the deſolation ſhal continue until the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and end,</hi> wherby our men prove that the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple shal not be built again: You anſwer; <hi>it is not in deed to be built again, but in the end of the world; or though it ſhould be built again, yet would it never be but prophane; or finally that it ſhal not be built again perfectly, but onely begun, and in it being begun, Antichriſt ſhal ſit.</hi> I anſwer, we had need of ſome <hi>Gerion,</hi> that with his hundred ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds may take this ſlipperie eel. How doo you wreath your ſelf into manifold boughts &amp; circles? yet though you should change your ſelf into a 1000. saps, you shal not ſlip away. who taught you, I pray, ſo to diſtinguish agai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nſt Daniel? It is not to be built again, ſay in the end of the world: or being built again, it shal abide prophane, or it shalt be built again not perfectly, but begun. Did you fet theſe things out of the Popes chappel? Surely the truth inſpired of God afforded not this unto you. For, that teacheth that <hi>wrath is come upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Jewes eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the utmoſt</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.16. &amp; that it is in part of this wrath, <hi>that God hath bowed down their backs alwayes,</hi> Rom. 11.10.
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:6819:297"/> Therfore the Iewes shal never ſo lift up themſelves under Antichriſt, as to have the leaſt power to entrepriſe anie ſuch thing: but shal alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine deſolate and oppreſſed, until they shal ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord;</hi> that is, until Chriſt ſhal come, and not Antichriſt. Mat. 23.39.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, wheras our men bring forth ſome places out of the Fathers, affirming that Antichriſt shal ſit in the Churches of Chriſtians, <hi>you grant it is true, and not againſt you; becauſe the Fathers would not ſay, that Antichriſt ſhall ſit in the Church as a Biſhop, but as a God.</hi> I anſwer, your Pope ſhal not ſcape away by this ridiculous diſtinction. The ſame man may ſit in the Church, both as a Bishop and as a God. Antichriſt shal ſuſtein the perſon of both: as we ſee in your Pope: in word he wil humbly feyn himſelfe a Bishop; but he wil arrogate the authoritie of God in deede. He wil forgive ſynns by ſome more ſuperiour power than a Miniſter can; he wil let out of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: he wil put into the Kalender of Saincts, whom he wil at his pleaſure; he wil command new articles of faith; and manie ſuch like things wil he doo that appertein not to this mortal condition, but to the higheſt Maie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtie. Why should the Fathers ſpeak of his Bishops office, in this ſo great a loftines? When great things are mentioned, the ſmaller matters ar wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be hidden with the exceding greatnes of the more excellent. By their ſilence they denied not that he should ſit in the Church as a Bishop: but when the higheſt pinnacle of pride was to be ſpoken of, they thought they were not to inſiſt in the lower ſtepps.</p>
                        <p>Vnto our mens fift argument, taken from the words of Gregorie lib. 4. Epiſt. 38. <hi>The King of pride is nigh, and (though it be heighnous to be ſpoken,) an armie of Preiſts is prepared for him:</hi> you ſay, <hi>from hence the contrarie is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to that which we collect. For it foloweth not that Antichriſt ſhalbe an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Biſhop: but the contrary, becauſe the forerunner is not al one with him, whom he runneth before.</hi> I anſwer, neyther is an univerſal Bishop alone with him that would be univerſal. The Bishop of Conſtantinople would have been; but he obteyned not his deſire: the Bishop of Rome, asked it of Phocas, and got it. The contrarie therfore is not gathered from hence, as you ſay, but it is rightly collected that Antichriſt shalbe an univerſal Bishop, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, none beſide Antichriſt could obteyn. And to the <hi>armie of Prieſts,</hi> you anſwer, <hi>that Gregorie would not ſay, that the Prieſts as Prieſts perteyned unto Antichriſts name: but that the Preiſts as being proud, prepared him an armie.</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, I ſay, that now the matter is paſt danger: the Popiſh Preiſts ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be proud. I trow when Antichriſt shal come, the Preiſts then wilbe either Popiſh or proud. What? Shal pride make a new order of Preiſts? Or if
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:6819:297"/> this haughtines be required in Antichriſts ſoldiers, wil ther be anie natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under the Sun, prouder than Popish Preiſts? Cardinals doo excel Kings: Archbishops and Bishops are ſuperiour to Barons and Earls; al in their order, doo goe before the civil honours; neither is ther anie of the baſeſt rowt of ſhavelings, that wil be under the civil Magiſtrate. Let Antichriſt therfore, ſeeke him ſoldjers otherwhere: he shal finde none in this lowlie flock of Popiſh Preiſts. Gregorie notwithſtanding verie expreſſly biddeth that Antichriſt be looked for as cheif Captain &amp; Emperour of the Preiſts. And other Preiſts ther are none on earth, by their own vaunting, beſides the Popish Preiſts. By his iudgment therfore the Bishop of Rome ſhould neceſſarilie be Antichriſt; and not farr from his time, ſeing by his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, armies were then prepared for him. Surely as Gaiphas propheſied that which himſelfe knew not: ſo Gregorie ſemeth unwares to have told the truth; not by anie power of his ſeat, but by the mercy of God ſo governing his tongue, that men might take heed by this admonition, &amp; the wicked world be made inexcuſable, as is obſerved Apoc. 8.13. Vayn therfore is that which is affirmed of Antichriſt to ſit in the temple of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſalem: and ſo farr is it off, that the Pope is not Antichriſt, becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tarieth at Rome: as ſo much the more he may therupon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be Antichriſt.</p>

                        <head>Chapt. 14. Of Antichrists doctrine.</head>
                        <p>THE doctrine of Antichriſt, we togither with the holy Ghoſt, doe teach from the ſcriptures, to be ful of hypocriſie, fraud, trecherie, which may deceiv even the moſt prudent, whom the Spirit inlightneth not with his truth. For one had need of ſingular prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy to know this Beaſt, which hath <hi>two horns like the Lamb,</hi> and is a falſe Prophet ſeducing the earth. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariweiſe the Papiſts wil have this ſame doctrine to be ſo openlie impious and blaſphemous, that none is ſo blockish, but he may perceive it forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and deteſt it.</p>
                        <p>Which that you Bellarmine may make playn, you reduce this all unto four heads. <hi>Firſt that he ſhal deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and therupon ſhal oppugn al our Saviours ordinances, as Baptiſm, Confirmation &amp;c. and ſhal teach that Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſion, the Sabbath, and other ceremonies of the old law, ar not yet ceaſed. Secondly, he ſhal affirme himſelfe to be the true Chriſt, promiſed in the Law and Prophets. Thirdly he ſhal affirme himſelfe to be God, and wil be honoured as God. Laſtly he ſhal ſay that himſelfe is the onely God, and ſhal oppugn al other Gods, that is, both the true God, and alſo falſe Gods and Idols.</hi> And from hence you take four ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:6819:298"/> that the Pope is not Antichriſt; <hi>becauſe he denyeth not Ieſus to be the Chriſt, neither bringeth he in Circumciſion; or the Sabbath: neither dooth he ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke himſelfe Chriſt, nor God, and leaſt of al the onely God: but honoureth even Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and dead Saincts.</hi> Which what force they have for this thing, we shal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſee in the confirmation which you bring. The firſt point therfor you confirm by this, that <hi>Antichriſt by nation and religion ſhalbe a Jew, &amp; be received of the Iewes for the Meſſias: wherupon he shal openly oppugn our Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, this foolish opinion of Antichriſts ſtock, we have ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed before, chap. 12. and 13. for he shal ſit <hi>in the temple of God,</hi> and not in Ieruſalems Temple, (which Chriſt foretold should be demolished, and never built again,) but in Chriſtian aſſemblies, as is declared at large: and therfore that he shal not be by religion a Iew, neither shal reſtore the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the old Law, which were tyed to the Temple, and had no pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce out of it. And how dooth it agree that Antichriſt the general plague of the whole earth, should be ſent into the world for the ſyn of one natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iewes in not receiving the truth, as ye would have it? Surely it were meet that he which should come for the wickednes of one natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, should be reſtreyned within the limits of that one nation: but ther is no need of new arguments for this matter.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, you ſay, <hi>it is proved from 1 John 2.22. Who is a lyar, but he that de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyeth Ieſus to be the Chriſt?</hi> From whence you gather, <hi>that Antichriſt ſhall ſurpaſſe al Heretiks, and therfore he shal deny Chriſt al manner of wayes: which is confirmed,</hi> you ſay, <hi>becauſe by Heretiks, the Divil is ſaid to work the Myſterie of iniquitie: becauſe they privilie doo deny Chriſt. But Antichriſts coming is caled a Revelation, becauſe he ſhal openly deny Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, as touching that of Iohn, I have shewed before, that this denyal which he ſpeaketh of, is not open, but ſecret and trecherous; to weet, by men named Chriſtians, which had privily crept in, and of whom the faithfull had need to be warned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherweiſe in danger to be ſurpriſed by them unwares. And though Antichriſt ſurpaſſe al Heretiks, yet is it not therfore neceſſarie that he should deal more openly than the reſt; ſeing the cheif reward of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is not to be given to the outward work, but to the power of doing hurt. For otherweiſe men should ſurmount the Divil himſelfe; who are ſo foolish in reſpect of him, as they doo that in the light, which he dooth moſt covertly. Moreover Antichriſts coming is a <hi>Revelation,</hi> but to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect onely: the others which beleev not the truth, he shal beguile by his crafty shewes, 2 Theſ. 2.11.12. The Angel requireth no common wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to know the Beaſt, and the whores name is myſtical, as before wee have been taught.</p>
                        <pb n="581" facs="tcp:6819:298"/>
                        <p>Thirdly you prove it <hi>by the ſentences of certain Fathers:</hi> but no equal jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge wil not confeſſe, that they are rather to be heard anie where ells, than in the matter of Antichriſt. Our Lord should conſume him <hi>with the Spirit of his mouth, and by his bright coming:</hi> wherupon the neerer the Lord should approch, the more was this <hi>man of ſyn</hi> to be diſcovered. I proceed therfore u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to the ceaſing of <hi>publik offices and divine ſacrifices</hi> (as you ſpeak,) which you ſay <hi>ſhalbe in Antichriſts time, for vehemencie of the perſecution, and that therfore he ſhal not deprave Chriſts doctrine, under the name of Chriſtianiſme, but openly shal oppugn Chriſts name and Sacraments, and bring in Jewish ceremonies, as you have shewed in chap. 7.</hi> I anſwer, at the ſame chapter I have proved that all theſe are moſt falſe: and that you hav not brought forth any thing, which hath ſo much as any likelihood of truth. And therfore that no other cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of publik religion is to be looked for, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as hath been theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie ages, to weet from Conſtantine the Great, unto this day: in al which time Antichriſt hath reigned. Whiles the <hi>woman</hi> lived in the <hi>wildernes,</hi> and the Saincts <hi>lay hid in the temple,</hi> ther was in deed a lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table fewnes of true worshipers: and ſo great darknes and obſcuritie poſſeſſed al things, more ſtore of ſmoke burſting forth daily out of the botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>leſſ pit, that the truth commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly could not be ſeen. Yet in the mean time Antichriſt dominered in the <hi>holy citie,</hi> and in the <hi>utmoſt court:</hi> wherupon by counterfeit religion he deceived egregiouſly, whiles al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> almoſt thought, becauſe of his neer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes unto the Temple, that he did ſit in the true Temple.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond chief point of doctrine,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is, that he shal openly and by name cal himſelfe the Chriſt, not his Miniſter and Vicar: as appeareth by thoſe words of our Lord, Jf an other shal come in his own name, him ye wil receive.</hi> And thoſe words <hi>in his owne name,</hi> you wittily warne <hi>to have been purpoſely added againſt the Lutherans and Calviniſts, which would ſay that Antichriſt should not come in his owne name, but in the name of our Chriſt, as if he were his Vicar.</hi> I anſwer, you underſtand Chriſts words verie perverſely. For <hi>name</hi> in this place, is not an <hi>appellation</hi> as you would have it, but a <hi>miſſion</hi> and <hi>authoritie</hi> as we hav shewed in the 2. chapter touching Antichriſts ſingular perſon. By which it may appear, that <hi>his own name,</hi> and the <hi>Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> doo not ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry one an other, but the Bishop of Rome may boaſt himſelfe to be this vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>car, and doo it alſo in his own name, to weet his own authoritie, having no ſuch right given him of God. Moreover if <hi>name</hi> be an <hi>appellation,</hi> &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichriſt shal come in his own name, and his appellation properly is not Chriſt: how, I pray you, dooth he openly &amp; by name cal himſelfe Chriſt? See you not, that you ſpeak contraries? Can any come in his own name, &amp; openly cal himſelfe an other, whoſe name he beareth not? Beſides, wee
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:6819:299"/> have often anſwered, that this place perteins nothing to Antichriſt proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſo caled, but to thoſe whom the Iewes should ſubmitt themſelves unto: who what manner of perſons ſo ever they were, they doo not in al points expreſſe the great Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>The third chief point of doctrine is, <hi>that he shal affirme himſelf to be God. and wil be worshiped for God, as it is written, ſo that he ſitteth in the Temple of God shewing himſelf as if he were God, 2. Theſ. 2.4. not onely,</hi> ſay you, <hi>by uſurping ſome of Gods authoritie, but the very name of God.</hi> And here becauſe your vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar authentik Latin text, is too weak to defend the Pope, you flee to the Greek, not <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>as God,</hi> ſay you, <hi>but</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>that he is God.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is this, <hi>Antichriſt shal in words acknowledge himſelfe to be God; the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of Rome dooth not acknowledge himſelfe to be God: therfore he is not Antichriſt.</hi> Let Oecumenius make anſwer to the propoſition, who thus interpreteth that word of the Apoſtle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>he ſaith not</hi> ſaying <hi>but</hi> shewing, <hi>that is, by works, ſignes, and miracles endevouring to shew that he is God.</hi> According to his interpretation therfore, a manifeſt publishing is not neceſſarie. Yea let the Holy Ghoſt expound himſelfe, who by a like manner of ſpeech in Ezek. 28.2. teacheth how this is to be taken. Thus he ſaith of the King of Tyrus, <hi>Becauſe thy hart is lifted up, ſo that thou ſayeſt, J am God.</hi> No man I trow, requireth that this Tyria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the ſelf ſame verie words. Falſe therfore it is, that Antichriſt should in word profeſſe himſelfe to be God. Notwithſtanding becauſe your Pope had liefer abound with toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, than barely and ſlenderly to be furnished with ſuch as are neceſſarie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: we forgive you the propoſition, and pray you to think with your ſelfe, whither the verie thing proclaimeth not quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to that which you deny in the aſſumption. For what, I pray you, did P. Sixtus acknowledg himſelfe and the other Popes of Rome to be, when he ſaid; <hi>Whoſoever accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth the Pope, it shal never be forgiven him: becauſe he that ſinneth againſt the holy Ghoſt, it shal not be forgiven him neither in this life, nor in that which is to come.</hi> Concil. Tom. 1. in Purgat. Sixti. What did Boniface the 8 when he ſaid, <hi>We declare, define, and pronounce that it is abſolutely neceſſarie to ſalvation, for eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie creature to be ſubiect to the Bishop of Rome.</hi> Extrav. de Major. &amp; Obed. u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſanctam. I forbear to cite more witneſſes; I appeal to your ſelfe; why doo you diſſemble? Doo not ſuch ſpeeches often ſound in your ears? <hi>But</hi> ſay you, <hi>he dooth not acknowledge himſelfe God, becauſe he acknowledgeth himſelf his ſervant.</hi> I am ashamed of your proofs; as if out of the ſame mouth ther could not come bleſsing and curſing, horrible blaſphemie, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit obedience. You know that in words, he is ſometime <hi>ſervant of ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:</hi> but again when he liſt, he is <hi>King of Kings,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="583" facs="tcp:6819:299"/>
                        <p>The fourth point is, <hi>that he ſhal extol himſelf above al that is caled God, or that is worshipped,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.4. <hi>that is.</hi> ſay you, <hi>he ſhal not ſuffer anie God, neither true nor falſe, nor anie Jdols.</hi> To this argument we have anſwered in part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in handling Antichriſts <hi>name;</hi> wher we shewed that the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not the heavenly God, but the earthly, that is, the civil Magiſtrates, which are venerable: as alſo that in Daniel 11.37. <hi>And he shal not eſteeme the God of his Fathers, nor care for anie God, becauſe he ſhall riſe up againſt all.</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom interpreteth this ſacrilegious pride, to be a kind of immoderate pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er over al religion; for thus he ſaith: <hi>And Antichriſt ſhal warre againſt the Saincts, and overcome them, and shal be pufft up with ſo great pride, as he shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to change Gods lawes and ceremonies, ſubiecting al religion to his owne power,</hi> Com. in Dan. cap. 7. In which words he finely painteth out Antichriſt &amp; the Pope of Rome, although he was farr from this your comment. For, ſhal a falſe Prophet lift up himſelf above everie God? A Prophet is always the Prophet of ſome God: needs therfore muſt he profeſſe himſelf ſubiect to ſome God, whom the Scriptures note out by the name of a <hi>Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> Again, when he shal ſit in the <hi>temple of God:</hi> whither shal this be in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of an other God, or in his own? If of an other, then he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth a ſuperiour: but if in his owne, then the Apoſtle ſpeaks unproper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and should not have ſaid, ſo that he ſitteth in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God as God; but rather, ſo that he ſitteth in his owne temple as God. But by this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, what fruit had redounded to the Saincts? For what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſign had this been of this Monſter; when it was no where known what manner of Temple he should have, or where? But thus ar they wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to erre from the right, which reverence their luſts for truth.</p>
                        <p>As touching the Idols, which you ſay <hi>Antichriſt shal deſpiſe,</hi> hereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you might shew that the Pope is worſe than Antichriſt; but it is alſo falſe, that Antichriſt shal deſpiſe Idols. <hi>Whoredome</hi> in the Scriptures is <hi>Jdo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latrie:</hi> and the Citie of Rome the ſeat of Antichriſt, is that Queen <hi>Iezabel,</hi> the chief <hi>whore,</hi> the great <hi>Babylon, the mother of al the whordoms and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth.</hi> Shal Idolatrie have dominion in his throne, and yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not be an Idolater? By whoſe authoritie dooth the whore worship I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, but by his on whoſe shoulders she ſitteth, and by the maieſtie of whoſe name she is ſuſteyned? Shal not Achab folow the Gods of his Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel? They which are killed by the four Angels looſed at Euphrates, doo ſuffer thoſe evils becauſe of Idolatrie, Apoc. 9.20.21. But the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, King <hi>Abaddon</hi> with his ſubiects ſuffreth that ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Euphratean Angels, whom he hath faſt behind him, Apoc 9.11.12. &amp;c. And therfore the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, is an Idolater,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:6819:300"/> who is al one with this Beaſt, as Apoc. 11.7. &amp; 17.8. But moſt plainlie, wher Antichriſt biddeth an <hi>Jmage</hi> to be made, and compelleth al the inha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitans of the earth <hi>to worship it,</hi> Apoc. 13.14.15. Doo you think this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wilbe a breaker down of Images? You are ſo farr from defending your Pope by this argument, as this is one of the chiefeſt ſignes, that he is the verie Antichriſt. Theſe therfore be trifles and guegawes, even as the other things which you have diſputed of Antichriſt. If you would have more certainty of his doctrine, remember the things which wee have often men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned out of this Apocalypſe. Here firſt you shall ſee, that Antichriſt is <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laam,</hi> and his ſeat <hi>Jezabel.</hi> chap. 2.14.20. And he, how crafty a knave was he? She, how Idolatrous a whore, and Propheteſſe; not defacing al religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship, but onely promoting and ſtablishing falſe worship? Then, you may perceive that the Gentils occupying the utter court and holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (while the Saincts in the meane time lye hidd in the temple,) are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt himſelfe and his ſubiects; chap. 11 1.2. And therfore that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is moſt neerly joynd in outward shew, to Chriſt: ſo as by his neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he shal deceiv many. Beſides, the great Antichriſt hath <hi>two horns lik the Lambe,</hi> chap. 13.11. Wherfore he shal not everie way be contrarie, but shal put on his Image, &amp; ſit as his Vicar: wheras he would reioice doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to be moſt unlike him, if he should shew manifeſt hoſtilitie. Finally, ſeing he is alſo a <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> he wil not boaſt himſelf to be the onely God but shal doo more harm by lying, than by force; and not shew himſelf to be ſuch as in deed he is. Theſe few things (to keep me within the limits of the Apocalypſe,) may teach you the true nature of Antichriſt; unleſſe you have leifer willingly to be ignorant, that you may the more confidentlie ſerve him.</p>

                        <p>CONCERNING the Miracles of Antichriſt, <hi>three things.</hi> you ſay, <hi>are found in the Scriptures: firſt, that he shal doo many miracles: ſecondly that they shalbe lyes: thirdly that ther are three examples ſet down:</hi> al which I eaſilie grant unto you. But why add you not ſomwhat to make it plain that the Pope is no kinn to Antichriſt, as that the Pope neither dooth <hi>many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> nor <hi>lyes,</hi> nor thoſe <hi>three exemples</hi> which you me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion by name? It ſeems you feared the triall: but you muſt needs be brought unto it, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your will. That he wel agrees with Antichriſt in multitude of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; neither can you, neyther doubtleſſe lyſt you to deny: ſeing this is one of the chief notes, wherin your Church glorieth. Of this firſt branch ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:6819:300"/> ther is no controverſie. But whither thoſe ſignes be <hi>lies,</hi> which are doon by the Popes &amp; their Miniſters, ſince Antichriſt firſt began to ſhew himſelfe, let us breifly conſider: that therby alſo may appear, whither the crime be true or falſe, which our men doo charge you with.</p>
                        <p>I wil not uſe that argument, which the Spirit maketh to be a ſure token of falſe miracles, namely, that whatſoever is doon for to confirm errour and ſuperſtition, is to be counted for a fraudulent ſign: (for you doo not acknowledge your errours, although this should be a ſufficient argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, unto them that have learned the truth:) but I wil bring ſuch as even your ſelves cannot deny. Let us therfote examine a litle thoſe famous miracles of <hi>Pope Sylveſter,</hi> to whom are attributed cheifly three. One <hi>that by ſacred Batpiſme he cured Conſtantine the Great, of a leproſie.</hi> An other, <hi>that he raiſed up agayn a bull that was killed by Zambri a Jewiſh ſorcerer.</hi> The third, <hi>that he bound a Dragon after a marvelous manner:</hi> As touching the Leproſie, everie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may eaſilie ſmel it to be but a ſtinking fiction by this, that the ancient writers that lived eyther next after Conſtantine, or togither with him, ſpeak not anie one word of the ſame. Euſebius who ſo diligently wrote his life and heaped up ſolemly unto his prayſe, whatſoever could any where be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: would not have conceled this ſingular benifit of God. It muſt needs therfore bee that the later writers drew al this out of the third ditch, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely from the Romiſh fables framed for this purpoſe onely, to encreaſe the Popes authoritie. Agayn, ſeing the curing of this Leproſie depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth on <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and it is certenly known that he was baptiſed, not by Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at Rome, but by Euſebius at Nicomedia, and that not in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his reign, but in the latter end of his life: who ſeeth not this cure to be altogither feighned and falſe? Euſebius telleth that he was baptiſed at Nicomedia a litle before he departed this life. <hi>Jn Vita Conſtant. lib. 4.</hi> Wherto agree Socrates lib. 1. cap. 39. Theodoret lib. 1. cap. 32. Sozom lib. 2. cap. 34. Ambroſe lib. <hi>De obitu Theodoſij &amp; Hieron. in Chronicis.</hi> But you on the othet ſide obiect Iſidorus, Zonaras, and Nicephorus, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but late writers in reſpect of thoſe ancients, what credit deſerv they in this thing? Could theſe later men know the truth more certaynly, which were furder off from al means to find it out? But let us ſee in a word, what ground every of them doo rely upon.</p>
                        <p>Iſidorus in his Chronicle, becauſe perhaps he knew that the Romans boaſted of Conſtantines baptiſme; and knew withal what the ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had ſaid of this matter: that both might be thought to be true, he wil have him <hi>baptiſed at Rome, but rebaptiſed by Euſebius of Nicomedia the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi> But he marketh not wel the ancient Hiſtorie, which with one conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:6819:301" rendition="simple:additions"/> reporteth that <hi>he deferred his Baptiſme unto that day, becauſe he deſired to be bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſed in Iordan.</hi> How did he deferr it, if he had received it before at Rome? Moreover he raſhly &amp; injuriouſly chargeth the godly Emperour with the greevous crime of violating his faith: who neither Euſebius of Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, nor any other Arrian could ever lead away from the truth; ſeing while he lived, he ſo reſtreyned them al by his authoritie, as they neither could nor durſt move anie thing againſt the faith eſtabliſhed. Socrates lib. 2. cap. 2. But the Ariminine ſynod abundantly teſtifieth in an Epiſtle to Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine his ſon, that he perſiſted conſtant in the true Nicene faith even to his laſt end. <hi>We have judged it abſurd,</hi> ſay they, <hi>even then ſo ſoon as he being baptiſed is departed from men, and gone unto his due reſt, after him to mind for to goe about a new thing, and to contemn ſuch holy Confeſſours and Martyrs.</hi> Theſe things agree not to a man fallen from the truth. And after that agayn; <hi>And this moreover we intreat you, that nothing be eyther taken away from the things which were before ordeyned, nor anie thing added: but that al things may remayn intyre &amp; unviolated, which through the pietie of your Father, are kept unto this very day.</hi> Theod. lib. 2. 19. Sozom lib. 4. 18. Farre be it therfore that we should think he made ſhipwrack of faith, and deſired a ſecond baptiſme of an Arrian. Zonaras mentioneth but one Baptiſme, and that by Sylveſter; but his tale agrees not with the truth. For he wil have it that Conſtantine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt forſook the worshiping of Idols, and was clenſed from his leproſie by the Baptiſme of Sylveſter, after that, Licinius being ſlayn, he alone had the ſoveraignty. But Euſebius a witneſſe then living, telleth how ſtraight after that miraculous ſight in heaven, he caled the Chriſtians to him, and by them was taught the whole way of ſalvation, that he gave himſelfe to the reading of holy Scriptures; had the Preiſts in great eſtimation, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he would worship no other God thenceforward. Euſeb. in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Conſtant. lib. 1. and his promiſe he indeed performed, as appeareth by thoſe Edicts in the behalfe of Chriſtians, which he togither with Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that reigned with him, cauſed to be promulgated. Euſeb. lib. 10. ca. 5. And was not he made a Chriſtian, until Sylveſter entred him into that profeſsion; when he made warr with Licinius, becauſe he uncourteouſly and yll intreated the Chriſtians? And wheras he relateth that Peter &amp; Paul by night appeared in his ſleep, and bade him ſend for Sylveſter: and that he asked of him whither Chriſtians worshipped the Gods caled <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> it is very ridiculous. Who are witneſſes, I pray you, that Peter and Paul appeared unto him by night? To whom did Conſtantine report this? Was it to Sylveſter, and not to Euſebius? Or how could he be ignorant of the Chriſtians God, who had before now ſo exactly learned of Chriſtians,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:6819:301" rendition="simple:additions"/> and himſelf read the holy Scriptures, and alſo vowed, that he would have no other God beſide Chriſt, as we shewed even now from Euſebius? And ſtrange it is that he should not ſend for Sylveſter, but when he was bidden by revelation, who from his firſt converſion, ſo familiarly uſed the holy Miniſters, as he had them for companions, <hi>even making the Preiſts of God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants to him:</hi> Euſeb. in the ſame place. Raſhly therfore did Zonaras pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the Romiſh Legends, before the more ancient faithful Hiſtorie. Nice<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phorus was moved by the authority of the Church of Rome; &amp; the Font which Conſtantine is ſayd to have made at Rome: as alſo for that the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour was admitted into the Nicen Synod, which the Fathers, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, would not have doon, unleſſe he had been before baptized. But as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the authoritie of the Church of Rome, and the Font, they ſhall be of ſome moment, and have their weight, when the Church of Rome ſhal have proved that she feighneth not in verie many other things. And that third thing, of place in the Synod, it is too leight for to diſcredit ſo ſufficient witneſſes. For why should they not admitt him into the Synod, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ought to admitt unto publik prayers, and the preaching of the word? A ſynod is as it were an aſſemblie of Propheſiers, from which, by the Apoſtles rule even infidels ar not to be excluded. <hi>But if all,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>propheſie, and ther come in one that is an unbeleever, or an unlearned one, he is rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of al, he is iudged of al: and ſo the ſecrets of his hart are made manifeſt, and ſo he wil fal down on his face and worſhip God, ſaying plainly that God is in you in deed.</hi> 1. Cor. 14.24.25. But Conſtantine had obteyned like precious faith with the other Saincts, &amp; therfore alſo might be partaker of the Spirit, as they on whom it fell before Baptiſm, Act. 10.44. &amp;c. And wheras he delayed his Baptiſme: the Fathers knew he did that not of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, but of a kind of religion; (of what manner, I diſpute not.) They might alſo think, that neither Moſes counted his children aliants from the covenant, though they were not circumciſed at the apointed day: neither were the Iſraelites forbidden to offer ſacrifices, and doo other ſervice of the Tabernacle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were not circumciſed in the wildernes. Wherfore ther was no cauſe, why entrance should be denied him into the Synod: ſeing al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the outward ſign, taketh not away from the faithful the right of children, either with God, or with men in the common duties of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. Foraſmuch then as it is certayn that Conſtantine was not baptiſed til the laſt part of his life: it is a lying fable, that Sylveſter ſhould clenſe him of his Leproſie by fotce of baptiſme adminiſtred 20. yeres before at the leaſt. And in deed ſo Iacobus de Voragine freely acknowledgeth, in the Legend of the finding of the holy Croſſ, ſpeaking of Conſtantines ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm;
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:6819:302"/> 
                           <hi>It is doubtful,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whither he deferred his baptiſm or no: wherupon ther is likeweiſe more doubt of the Legend of Sainct Sylveſter.</hi> And a litle after, <hi>It is evident that ther are manie things in the Hiſtorie, which are recited in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are not conſonant to the truth.</hi> He ſpeaketh of the invention of the Croſſ: but ther is the ſame reſpect of al Legends. This therfore is a lying miracle, which is not confirmed by anie ſufficient witneſſe, and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the true Hiſtorie.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond miracle is of a Bull rayſed up againe by Sylveſter, which Za<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres a Iew (the laſt of the twelv which diſputed againſt the truth of Chriſt) by mumbling ſome words in his ear, made fall down dead ſuddenly. This fable is like the former. None of the ancient writers, that either lived in thoſe times, or ſucceded next, doo ſpeak any one word of this thing. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ly he was not yet born, that should forge this tale from Iuſtin Martyrs diſputation with Trypho. Moreover Zonaras telleth the thing as if Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na the mother of Conſtantine were togither with her ſon at Rome. The Legend wil have her to be abſent at the converſion of her ſon in Iudea, &amp; ſtomaking that he was made a Chriſtian, she haſtened thence to Rome, with 149. learned Iewes, to make trial of the truth by diſputing. Agayn the Legend is not onely contrarie to Zonaras, but even to it ſelfe. For in the life of Sylveſter, it ſaith, that <hi>Helena went into Judea before her converſion;</hi> and in the Legend of the Invention of the Croſſ, it ſaith, <hi>after her converſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For she went to ſeek the Lords Croſſe. And certain it is, she made this journey but once, being alſo aged, and her nephewes conſtituted Caeſars; as Euſebius tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eth in vita Conſtant, lib. 3. This ſign alſo relyeth upon no other beſide ſuch vain witneſſes: and whither it be a lye or no, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now iudge.</p>
                        <p>The third miracle is of a <hi>Dragon</hi> lurking in a great deep ditch, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing malcontent for the converſion of Conſtantine and his people, killed dayly with his breath more than 300 men. Vnto this Dragon, did Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter deſcend with two Preiſts, at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Peter and Paul that appeared unto him: and tyed his chapps with a threed, and ſealed with a ring that had the ſign of the croſſ upon it. This miracle it is ynough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat; it were folly to refute. By theſe miracles therfore of Sylveſter, men may judge of the reſt. But, you wil ſay, theſe things perhaps are falſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him. I anſwer, it is al one, whither the Pope himſelfe doo falſe miracles, or that falſe ones be aſcribed to him by his men. Al tend to one end, <hi>that the Beaſt may be worſhiped,</hi> that is, that the Pope may have chiefeſt honour.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I ſay, that miracles were ceaſed in the times of Chryſoſtome
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:6819:302"/> and Auguſtine: for ſo Chryſoſtome on 1. Cor. 2. Homil. 6. renders a rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, why ſigns were doon in the Apoſtles time, and in his time not; name<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly becauſe <hi>by how much the more certayn and neceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And again, they ſay, why ar not the miracles doon, which are reported to have been doon?

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, had put an end to the old miracles, before that age: that Antichriſt with his mates might the better be known, when he should come forth, with his new pomp of miracles.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, ther are not wanting men of your own crew, which have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the vanitie of your miracles; as Alexander de Hales, par. 4. quaeſt. 53. mem 4. art. 3. Solu. 2. <hi>Jn the Sacrament ther appeareth fleſh, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by mans procurement, ſometime by the Divils operation.</hi> And Nicol. Lyra on Daniel: <hi>Sometime in the Church the people are greatly deceived with miracles feighned by the Preiſts, or ſuch as ſtick unto them for lucre.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, examples alſo prove it, ſuch as (to omitt innumerable others) were in that famous conflict of the Franciſcans and Dominicans among the men of Berne, about the birth of the B. Virgin Mary. <hi>Certain Monks,</hi> as Peucerus telleth, in his 5. book of Chronicles) <hi>when they could not prevail by authoritie of teſtimonies, betook themſelves for help unto juggling ſteights: For hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves in an Jmage of the Bleſſed Virgin, that was artificially made for this purpoſe, they counterfeyted in her marvelous geſtures: ſo as they perſuaded the people, that ſhe did mourn, lament, complayn, ſhed tears, and give anſwesr to them that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of her. Which fraud being manifeſted, the authors of it were burned the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kalends of Iuly, in the yere 1590.</hi> Wher is to be obſerved that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit was hid from the ignorant people, before ther roſe a contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the religious themſelves, to weet, the maſters of theſe jugglings,
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:6819:303"/> who knowing wel by what ſleight they were wont to deceive the world, did eaſily find out the authors of ſuch a wicked prank. But let me come unto your own familie; you know that at Rome the nam of one <hi>Father Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> a Ieſuite was famous, who firſt feighned himſelfe a leper, that he might deceiv men by a lying miracle of receaving his health. Then when this ſucceeded wel with him, he feighned that his Ieſuitical habit was ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through with the bullet of a certain gun ſhut off; but when the ſame came to his flesh, by Gods admirable power it rebounded back without anie hurting of him. Why yea, for Ieſuits bodyes be brazen walls. Theſe things at the firſt were beleeved; afterwards they were found falſe: ſo that now at Rome, when any impudent fraud is caſt in a mans teeth, he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the ſecond Iuſtinian.</hi> But this is no new thing to Ieſuits, whom many of your owne ſide doo confeſſe, (as is publikly reported,) to make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſembling, diſſembling, feighning, and belying al things, ſo as it be for their benefit. For this cauſe they ſpeak ſhrewdly of the miracles of Ignatius, and your Xaverius, in whom you glorie, not onely as a principal ornament of the order of Ieſuits, but alſo of the whole Popish religion: De notis Eccleſiae, lib. 4. cap. 14. And it is no marvel though Xaverius amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Indians, ſo farr from al trial, did al thoſe marvelous works, which Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phaeus Ribademeirus and Turſellinus make mention of. It is rather to be marveled that he dyed the common death, and was not rather taken away in a fyerie charret, that being reſerved with Henoch and Elias, he might come at laſt to deſtroy Antichriſt. Doo you give credit to theſe Indian let<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you may remember how that the Ieſuits published in a book ſet out, that Theodore Beza was dead, and before he gave up the Ghoſt, was converted, by means of one of your men, to your Romish religion; &amp; that by his exemple, manie other citizens of Geneva renouncing their for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer errours, embraced the Popish doctrine? You have not forgotten, I trow, (for ignorant you cannot be of a matter ſo rife in al mens mouthes) how Theod. Beza being marvelouſly raiſed again from the dead, did by letters written in French and Latine, ingrave as on a publik pillar for all Chriſtendom, the incredible impudency of your Ieſuits. Now therfore you may publiſh the Indian miracles of Xaverius, when your ſo egregious pranks be in the open light and eyes of all Europe. Endleſſe it were to ſail into the ſea of al your lying ſignes; therfore had I liefer to relate one or 2. both publikly teſtified, and fresh in memorie; than manie other almoſt forgot with age. Wherfore your Pope dooth ſo lively expreſſe Antichriſt both in multitude and falſitie of miracles, that none I beleev is ſo sharp ſighted, as that he can diſcern any even the leaſt difference.</p>
                        <pb n="591" facs="tcp:6819:303"/>
                        <p>Ther remayn thoſe three ſpecial miracles, namely, <hi>of fyre coming down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven; of the Jmage of the Beaſt to ſpeak; and of the reſurrection of Antichriſt, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned</hi> Apoc. 13. where I have shewed how theſe all doo fitly agree to the Pope of Rome. For firſt we declared that theſe things are to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded figuratively, not properly; for theſe are miracles common to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (ſuch as by the Apocalypſe we have proved the great Antichriſt to be,) and not of a ſingular man. And that commonly they cannot agree to many ſingulars, ſave figuratively. Moreover if theſe miracles should be perſonal, and proper to one, how could they ſo come to the knowledge of the whole world, that it should folow the Beaſt, with ſuch admiration, as the Apocalypſe ſayth? Things heard, doo move leſſe than thoſe that ar ſeen with the eyes. And Antichriſt should excel with ſuch efficacie of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, as he should ſeduce (if it were poſsible) the verie elect: therfore it is altogither abſurd to interpret theſe properly. We shewed that the <hi>fyre co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down from heaven,</hi> is the fear and terrour of Gods iudgement; which Antichriſt should ſtrike into men that obey not his will: that his <hi>reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on,</hi> is the curing of his wounded head, when the papal dignitie which by the invaſion of the Barbarians ſeemed to have perished, began agayn to wex ſtrong and flourish: that <hi>ſpeech given to the Jmage of the Beaſt,</hi> is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of commaunding, unto which the relived Pope did aſpire, prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that al that eminencie which he deſired was no more, than the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Popes poſſeſſed of old; wherupon his dignitie was but onely an Image of the ancient. Theſe are the natural interpretations of theſe miracles, un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to which the conſent of the whole Apocalypſe leadeth: although if yow would ſtrictly hold the letter; we shewed examples of fyre deſcending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven at the will of the Popes, Apoc. 13.13. Francis Xavier Ieſuite, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dead by heaps, a few yeres ſince among the Indians: and we rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even now out of Peucerus, that an Image in Berne, by means of your men, gave anſwers to them that asked therof. Neither need we ſeek anie other, until you have shewed, that theſe things muſt be underſtood as the words doo ſound. Here we have nothing but your bare affirmation. In the mean while ther is no doubt but thoſe three things which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures mention of Antichriſts miracles, are al found in your Pope, both multitude, and fraud, and ſpecial examples: and therfore that he is the man of ſyn, whom the Apocalypſe deſcribeth, and Paul foretold to the Theſſalonians, Epiſt. 2. But although you could bring nothing in the whole firſt part of the chapter, wherby to purge the Pope of this impietie by teſtimonie of miracles: yet that you might ſeem to have ſaid ſomthing, you wil anſwer our men, which let us ſee of what ſort it is. <hi>The writers of
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:6819:304"/> Maydenburgh,</hi> ſay you, <hi>doo obiect that manie lying miracles have been doon by the Papiſts, ſuch as by viſions of ſowles telling tales of Purgatorie, and begging maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be ſung for them; and cures of diſeaſes which have happened to ſuch as worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Images, or made vowes unto Saincts.</hi> And you anſwer two things: <hi>firſt that theſe are not the miracles which John writeth that Antichriſt ſhal doo; but to dye and riſe again; to let down fyre from heaven; to give the Jmage power to ſpeak: which you require to be ſhewed, to have been doon by the Pope or Papicts.</hi> I anſwer, that I have shewed <hi>the Pope was dead</hi> when Rome was taken by the Barbarians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being driven away, and he promoted to his former glorie, he <hi>roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> That <hi>he let down fyre from heaven,</hi> after he had perſuaded the world, that it was of neceſsity to ſalvation, for to be under the Bishop of Rome; for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wrath terrified all men, as if it were the wrath of the great God. That he <hi>gave the Image power to ſpeak,</hi> when he came to ſuch boldnes, as he freely boaſted both in deed and word; <hi>By me Kings reign.</hi> Al which mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ar alſo doon by the Papiſts, which apply their labour for the Pope, wherby he may the more eaſily delude the world with theſe perſuaſions. Though Images alſo doo ſpeak among you: Xaverius raiſeth the dead, &amp; for the Popes ſake, flames have appeared from heaven.</p>
                        <p>Secondly you anſwer, <hi>that thoſe three kinds of Miracles, namelie viſions of ſowls craving maſſes to be ſung for them; healths obteined by worſhiping of Jmages, &amp; for vowes made to Saincts, were uſual in the Church before that time when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſay, Antichriſt appeared.</hi> I anſwer, that which you affirme is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, partly of no moment, to prove your Miracles not to be lyes. Falſe it is which you ſay that the ſowl appearing to S. German Bishop of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua about the yere 500. was before Antichriſts time. For the Apocalypſe teacheth that Antichriſt was born, when the Hethen Emperours were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, which fel out about the yere of our Lord 300. Infirme altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is which you allege of the like miracles doon before Antichriſt, as Euſebius relateth, lib. 7. Hiſt. cap. 14. of the brazen Statue which the woman that had the bloody yſſue erected to our Saviour; and Theodoret lib. 8. ad Graecos. For both before Antichriſt, and after his coming, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignes should be doon. For <hi>now,</hi> ſayth Paul, <hi>the Myſterie of iniquitie worketh,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.7. And the Myſterie wrought as wel by Myracles, as by ſuperſtition and falſe doctrine, as appeareth by the Heretik Mark, who made the wine in the Cup to appear bloud, of whom Irenaeus ſpeaketh, lib. 1. cap. 9. So the Montaniſts alſo had their miracles, as Tertullian te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, lib. de Anim. cap. Nihil animae. And the difference between the great Antichriſt and theſe litle ones, is in more and leſſe. For theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners did Miracles, by a shorter and ſtraiter kind of power: But the
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:6819:304"/> great Antichriſt should come with the efficacy of Sathan, with al power, namely to deceive in larger borders Wherupon he should exceed in great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, multitude, and impudency of guiles, and al kind of hurting. Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therfore is your defenſe of the Pope by Miracles, which if in any thing ells, doo plainly shew him to be the great Antichriſt. Neither was it, as I think, without the ſingular providence of God, that you which make mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to be one chief mark of the Church, should at length know by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they wil turne to your deſtruction, who hoped by them to have greateſt ſafegard.</p>

                        <head>Chapt. 16. Of Antichriſts Kingdome and warrs.</head>
                        <p>TOVCHING the Kingdome and warrs of Antichriſt, we have taught the certainty from the Apocalypſe chap. 11.7. and chap. 13. entyre; from whence the Reader may fetch the things that are to be holden of them both; and not from theſe durty ditches of the Ieſuits. But you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe matters doo propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d four things from the Scriptures as you ſay. <hi>Firſt that Antichr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ſt coming from verie low degree, ſhal by fraud and guiles obteyn the Kingdome of the Iewes. Secondly that he ſhal fight with three Kings, to weet, of Aegipt, Libya, and Aethiopia; and conquering them ſhal poſſeſſe their King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes. Thirdly that he ſhal ſubdue under him other ſeven Kings, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner he ſhal become Monarch of the whole world. Fourthly that with an army innu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>merable he ſhal purſue the Chriſtians through the whole world: and that this is the warr of Gog and Magog. Of al which things, ſeing none doo agree to the Pope of Rome, it foloweth manifeſtly, that he can no way be caled Antichriſt.</hi> I anſwer, neither dooth anie of theſe agree unto Antichriſt properly ſo caled: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore though the Pope of Rome be diſcharged of al theſe, yet never the leſſe he wil be the Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>As touching the firſt, Antichriſts baſe original is onely touched: for that which is joyned with it, of getting the <hi>Kingdom of the Jewes,</hi> in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation nothing is ſayd of it: and reaſon good, ſeing it is moſt vain, as hath been already before declared. His baſe original therfore is prooved out of Dan. 11.21. <hi>Ther ſhal ſtand up in his place, a deſpiſed perſon, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Kingdome ſhalbe given to him, and he ſhal come privilie, and ſhal get the Kingdome by frawd.</hi> You confeſſe, being moved by Ieroms authority, <hi>that theſe things are to be underſtood in ſome ſort of Antiochus Epiphanes, yet by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Ieroms iudgement, are to be farr more perfectlie fulfilled in Antichriſt, as the
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:6819:305"/> things which are ſpoken in Pſalm 71. of Solomon, are meant verily of Solomon, but more perfectly fulfilled in Chriſt.</hi> I anſwer, this is altogither unlike; Solomon was appointed of God a type of Chriſt; but ſo was not Antiochus of Anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chriſt, unleſſe you wil proroge Antichriſts reign, and for three yeres and a halfe, grant him ſix and a halfe; as many as Antiochus tyrannized over the Saincts. Moreover Antiochus was conſtreyned to be quiet, by comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement of the Roman Legat: ſhal any in like ſort command Antichriſt, which shalbe cheif Monarch? Again Antiochus was an Ethnik and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither an aliant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church: ſhal Antichriſt alſo be ſuch an one? Learn therfore at laſt not to take anie thing of anie body indifere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly; but uſe the ballance, to try what is ſpoken, if you have any care of the truth. Certain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly if you would caſt a right account, you wil rather acknowledge the origi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal of the true Antichriſt to be famous. Doo you not ſee that he weareth <hi>crowns on his horns,</hi> ſo ſoon as he is born? Apoc. 13.1. Was he not to ariſe at Rome the Emperial citie: where what can be baſe, that is placed in any dignitie? The Bishop of Rome, as yee are willing to mention, was of great authoritie, becauſe of the dignitie of the citie, with all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, before the Emperours gave place unto him. And I hope that I have shewed you ſuch ſignes of Antichriſt, as you wil now doubt no more, but this Bishop is even he; if ſo be you wil freely confeſſe the thing as it is. Therfore the teſtimonies which you bring of the amplitude and gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Bishop of Rome, doo more vehemently prove him to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, than that which you bring out of Daniel, prove that he is not.</p>
                        <p>Secondly for his fight with the three Kings, of Aegipt, Libya and Aethi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>opia, you relate that of Daniel, chap. 7.8. <hi>J conſidered the horns, and loe an other litle horn came up among them, and three of the firſt horns were pluckt away be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore him:</hi> and after explaining it he ſaith, <hi>and the ten horns ſhalbe ten Kings &amp;c. which three are explained,</hi> you ſay, <hi>who they are, chap. 11.47. namely the Kings of Aegipt, Libya, and Aethiopia.</hi> I anſwer, that litle horn, is not Antichriſt properly ſo caled, as I have shewed in the ſecond chapter of this Refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and often other where, but the Mahumetan Turk. Wherupon in that your Pope of Rome hath killed no Kings of Aegipt, Libya and Aethiopia, it may in deed be proved, that he is not the Mahumeta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Turk: but it dooth no more appear from hence that he is not Antichriſt, than that David of old was not King of Iſrael, becauſe he never ſubdued theſe ſame 3. Kings. The killing of theſe Kings by the Pope, perteyns nothing to this cauſe. He is fowl ynough with the bloud of Europe and at home, though he never come into the Libyan and Aethiopian deſerts. Moreover it may alſo be, that theſe three Kings, are not thoſe 3. horns plucked away: for they are
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:6819:305"/> the horns of the fourth Beaſt, as is plainly ſaid; three of thoſe firſt hornes were rooled out from his face. But theſe three Kings, neither a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were horns of the Roman Empire. Aethiopia was never ſubject to the Romans, who inlarged not their borders ſouthward further than Aegipt. Again, three horns are pluckt away from b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>fore him: but theſe three wer not al to be overcome: but the Libyans and Aethiopians should be onely at his footſteps, as peoples ayding him rather than ſubdued; who should afford him ſouldjers for his expeditions, and not themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The third point of <hi>ſubduing ſeven Kings,</hi> is of like ſtrength. <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> ſo,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Lactantius and Jreneus doe interpret it.</hi> But whither should we hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them or to Daniel rather? Certainly the Prophet plainly confirming that three horns are pluckt away, exempteth al the reſt from his power: otherweiſe he should have ſaid that al ten shal perish: or how should he be <hi>a litle horn</hi> which should get the command over al? But whither ſeven or three be ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iected to that litle horn, this is nothing to Antichriſt: unto whom all his ten horns, as we have shewed, doo ſervice from the beginning, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by warr, but willingly and of their own accord. The Fathers in deed perceived not what thoſe three horns should be; but the event hath taught us, that the Turk hath robbed the third part of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Empire, which hath yet notwithſtanding ſeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hornes left, of which he shal not be Lord, but ſo farr forth as he may bring upon them ſome short and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn overthrow. Therfore this horn belongeth nothing at al unto this great Antichriſt. But where you ſay he shalbe a Monarch, &amp; shal ſucceed the Romans in Monarchie, as the Romans did the Greeks, the Greeks the Perſians, the Perſians the Aſsyrians: this hath more ground, ſeing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhal lift up himſelfe above al which Is caled God, 2 Theſſ. 2.4. &amp; the whole earth wondring should folow the Beaſt, neither acknowledgeth he any his like, or able to fight with him, Apoc. 13.3.4 As alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeing he should have for a throne, the great citie, which reigneth over the Kings of the earth, Apoc. 17.18. Theſe and the like doo truly prove him a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch But this, ſay you, dooth no way agree to the Bishop of Rome; for he was never King of the whole world. But were the Romans. I pray you, ever Kings of the whole world? I think you wil not deny it; as theſe words uſually are wont to be underſtood; or if you like to ſtand curiouſly heru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, Daniel teacheth, that the fourth Kingdom, to weet the Roman, ſhal conſume the whole earth, ſhal cruſh it, and break it in peeces, chap. 7.23. Remember therfore what a litle before you alleged out of <hi>Proſper: Rome by
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:6819:306" rendition="simple:additions"/> Principality of the Preiſthood was made more ample with the towr of religion, than with the throne of power.</hi> And what Leo ſaith, Serm. 1. de Natal. Apoſtol. <hi>Rome that art made the head of the world by the holy Seat of</hi> S. <hi>Peter, thou ruleſt more largely by divine religion, than by earthly domination.</hi> And what els mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the triple crown, but the principalitie over al the three parts of the world? The Popes crown hath more tops, than the Emperours Egle hath heads. It may be, that shortly it wil be quadruple, by the acceſsion of the Indians, that nothing may eſcape the Popes almightines, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a time hath been hidd from his all skilfulnes. Wherfore the ſtreights of his dominion, neither ſtand you in anie ſtead to acquitt the Pope of this wickednes, neither is this remembrance grateful unto him, who dooth ſo contemn honours and Empire, as he had liefer with large limits of ruling to be counted Antichriſt, than to be defended by an argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdome loſt or diminished.</p>
                        <p>The fourth branch is <hi>the battel of Gog and Magog, Apoc. 20. And when the 1000 yeres are ended &amp;c. Jn this battel,</hi> you ſay, <hi>he ſhal with an armie innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, perſecute Chriſtians through the whole world.</hi> I anſwer, we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already from theſe words, the wonderful expedition of Antichriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole world properly ſo caled; before in the 7. chapter of his perſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cution. And there we allowed for this expedition three yeres and a halfe: but here now it ſeemeth that this whole ſpace shal not be ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; but then it ſhal be taken in hand, after the three Kings and the ſeven Kings be ſubdued. There alſo we marveled if he should goe ſuch a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney himſelfe alone, not hindred with anie troup of wayting men: but here furder comes the impediment of an armie, and the ſame nevertheleſſe an univerſal perſecution. Surely whatſoever you ſaid before againſt Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, you ſeem plainly to think that Antichriſt is no man, but the Divil him ſelfe. But to let theſe monſters paſſe, let us come to the battel: which I mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vel you ſaw not that it should be by the Dragon, not by the Beaſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which two, ther is in deed a great ſocietie of wickednes; but no leſſ difference of perſons and of things, than is between an open foe, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enemie. Add hereunto that the Beaſt and falſe Prophet are both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, before this warre is taken in hand, or at leaſt before it is finished: if that move you not, that both of them are mentioned to be ſlain in the end of the former chapter; yet conſider that the Divil, that is the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                           <hi>was caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> wher the other have their place, before that the Divil comes thether; Apoc. 20.10. Although therfore Antichriſt be a Martial felow and a great warrier; yet shal he wage no warrs after he is dead. But it is one of his miracles to riſe againe. Be it ſo, when he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeyts
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:6819:306"/> a death, as you feign of him: but when he is ſlayn by that hand of God, and deeply drowned in the lake of fyre, he shal not find it ſo eaſi to riſe again, and when he lay under a coverlet. Separate you therfore thoſe things which touch not Antichriſt; and deal not ſo, as if you would prove one not to be a man, either becauſe he hath not four feet, or becauſe he wanteth wings; &amp; you shal ſee the reſt, ſo to agree togither among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in al points, as nothing more. Surely the things which you hav diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of this Kingdome and warr, are farr from every part eyther of the Kingdome or of the warr of Antichriſt: but ſuch ſtuff as this, are al the things that your men are either wont or able to bring, for to defend the Pope, and to free him from this moſt greevous crime. Therfore you toyl in vayn: the thing is manifeſt, it can not be hidd by anie ſubtilties. Why goe ye about to caſt a myſt before the Sun? Why frame yee arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spirit of God? Purge rather with flames, thoſe writings of yours, wherwith yow have laboured his defenſe: and flee out of his denn, as ſpeedily as you can.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>And after theſe things J ſaw an Angel come down:</hi> In deſtroying the Citie of Rome God wil manifeſt to the world his admirable long ſuffring, who beſide al his former warnings, ſo many, and ſo divers, cometh not to the laſt deſtruction, before three Angels be uſed, by whoſe voice men should be warned to avoid the plague coming violently upon it. The firſt of theſe is an <hi>Angel deſcending from heaven,</hi> that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome excellent and ſingular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who shal come ſuddenly, and not looked for, even as things which fall down from heaven. The things which are borne with us give ſome shew of themſelves before they wex ripe; but things that come from heaven, may be preſent in a moment without anie perceiving taken before they come. So in the tenth chapter <hi>and Angel came down from heaven,</hi> of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when many couragious deffendours of the truth were riſen up, of whom before there was no ſuſpicion. VVhich thing other places co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm, which may be taken from the former interpretation. This Angel ſeemeth, that by a ſudden converting to the truth, he shall manifeſt to al men, <hi>that he cometh from heaven.</hi> Such was that coming down in the tenth chapter, where men brought up in ſuperſtition, became ſuddenly nourriſſons of true godlines. This <hi>Angel hath great power.</hi> But to what end? For no excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent great acte of his is mentioned: it may be he is that man to whom is committed wholly the throwing down of this throne: who shal not ſo much bring a new Propphecy concerning the ruine of Babylon, as ſhew himſelfe prepared to performe the verie thing, which the divine oracles prophecied often should come. Thirdly, <hi>the earth is lightened with his glory,</hi> becauſe eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which are ſtrangers from the true Church shal honour, and admire the glory of his godlineſſe and excellent maieſtie. <hi>He ſhalbe wel reported off, even of them that are without,</hi> as ſpeaketh the Apoſtle. The like uſe of words in the things paſt, doth give us this knowledge of this Angel, though yet to come. VVhich is the onely way to pearſe into theſe things otherwaies hidden from us. But it is to be obſerved, that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, as farr as it ſeemeth, shal not come forth by and by after that manife<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtation of the throne, which we have ſpoken of in the former chapter; but
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:6819:308"/> at length after ſome certain and meet time ſet between. And therfore this viſion is divided from the former by that uſual ſtile in writing of a diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time ſomwhat farther of, <hi>and after theſe things I ſaw.</hi>

Although peradventure no ſuch denuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made in words is not to be expected; but even the very attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the thing shall ſtirre up in the mindes of men that opinion, as if they did heare this voice ſounding in the eares of men. But ſeing this cry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing out is of one Angel, to whom the buſineſſe is committed as is like, of deſtroying, and burning Rome, it may confirme ſomewhat that which we have ſayd in the former chapter; that ſome one of the tenne hornes, to whom the reſt of the multitude is figuratively adioyned; not that whole number, <hi>ſhal bring upon it this laſt deſolation.</hi> He cryeth out with a voice dou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled, <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen Babylon,</hi> after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the former Prophets, but yet with this difference, becauſe they denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced a deſtruction to come long after, this declareth that it is already preſent, now at laſt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by this his expedition. <hi>Babylon that great,</hi> the ſeven hilled citie, the chief Empreſſe Rome, as once Babylon the head citie of the Aſſyrians. There is a double Babylon in this book, as we have heard chap. 16., <hi>Rome and Conctantinople.</hi> But here he ſpeaketh of the firſt, which belongeth to the fift vial, in which this chapter is employed. The ſecond belongeth to the laſt vial, to be deſtroyed in the twentith chapter</p>

                  <hi>¶ And is become the habitation of Divils:</hi> The cauſe of the deſtruction is not here mentioned, which foloweth after in ver. 3. but the deſolation is declared by a dreadful wilderneſſe, which this kind of inhabitans reioicing in ſolitary places and folowing them, doo expreſſe paſsingly.

Of which ſort many are reckned up in Levit. 11.13. &amp;c. And ſuch birds were once counted uncleane by the Law. Such difference hath no place at this day: yet not without cauſe they are ſo called to this preſent time, becauſe they excellently ſet before our eyes the diſpoſition of uncleane men, who live by ſtelth, and know no other way to maintaine themſelves, except by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injurie. In this reſpect alſo thoſe greedie birdes are hated of all the reſt, as they shew by gathering a company, as often as they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten one of theſe ravenous birds alone, and any occaſion ſhall give an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to oppreſſe them; likeweiſe alſo this kind of men is odious to al mortal men.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Becauſe of the wine of the wrath.</hi> A threefold cauſe of the deſtruction is rehearſed, becauſe <hi>ſhe was the authour of Idolatry to al men;</hi> becauſe <hi>ſhe drewe the Kings into the partaking of her wickednes; and increaſed with honours &amp; riches

Therfore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that the ſhameleſſe forehead of this whore is ſtil condemned of the ſame crime, which can be moved with no warnings to put away her former lewdneſſe. As touching the words, <hi>the wine of the wrath of her forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> is a fornication wherby God is provoked to wrath, yet ſo making wretched men drunken for a time with a certen pleaſantneſſe, that it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away all perceiving of the impiety therof, as in chap. 14.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ All nations have drunk;</hi> Montanus hath it ranſitively, thus; <hi>hath made the nations to drink:</hi> and ſo her wickedneſſe is more lively ſet forth, &amp; more becomming her, <hi>which beareth a cup of Gold in her hand,</hi> wherby shee may provoke even thoſe that are not thirſty to drink, as before chap. 14.8. It is an horrible ſinne <hi>to put a ſtumbling block before the blind:</hi> but what is it to thruſt and throw him headlong into the pit? But the kinde of ſpeaking ſeemeth to be changed of purpoſe, leaſt any man should alledge for his excuſe, that he hath not deceived others. Therfore this common reading is to be preferred which our coppies have; which alſo the verbes neuters which folow <hi>eporneuſan eplouteſan,</hi> ſeeme to require.</p>

                  </gap> from the force of her riot, that is, from the plenty and immoderate deſire to enioy al pleaſures. For Rome is an other Zerxes who by rewards offered, ſtirred up men to deviſe newe pleaſures.

<pb n="604" facs="tcp:6819:310"/> the ſtately Lords Cardinals, Archbishops, Popiſh Bishops, who exerciſe a marchandiſe of ſoules, and flouriſh by this marchandiſe with the glory of Noble men. For we shal ſee after, that Rome is compared to Tyrus, becauſe she is no leſſe noble a marte town of ſpiritual things, then once Tyrus of al thoſe things which belong to the deligts of this life, as we may ſee in Pope Alexander, of whom was this ſung common:

               <p n="4">4 <hi>And I heard an other voice:</hi> Such is the firſt Angel, and the Prince as it ſeemeth of this warre: the ſecond as an under Captaine dooth his office in counſelling and exhorting. But here is no mention made of the Angel, but onely of a voice from heaven, as though this exhortation were <hi>without an authour,</hi> his name being concealed from whom it commeth. For which cauſe we have ſaid in the Analyſis that this Angel is nameleſſe. It is in deed an odious argument which he handleth, wherupon peradventure he will conceale his name, which being known would bring no profit, but might procure ſome danger, the adverſaries being of ſo ſpitefull minds. His ſpeech is continued even unto the one and twentith verſe; ſo copious ſhal be the admonition of ſome faithfull man, which togither with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to this warre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, shalbe ſpread abroad, godly and truly warning men of the preſent punishment of Rome. Notwithſtanding that which wee have ſpoken of his name concealed is not of ſuch neceſsity, as that it muſt needs be ſo, ſeeing the like voice from heaven did shew his author, as the event declared, chap. 14.13. But it is likely to be true that the name is to be concealed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Goe out of her my people:</hi> The exhortation conſiſteth of two parts, the firſt part perteineth to them which live in Babylon, warning them that acknowledging at the length the filthineſſe of that citie, they forſake the ſame, and depart to an other place; that they would no longer for her ſake expoſe themſelves to certain deſtruction. Wherfore ſome elect lie hidd yet in the dreggs of the Romish impietie, whom God remembreth in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon deſtruction of the wicked. He will not ſuffer Lot to periſh togither with the Sodomits: and he uſed the like exhortation long ſince to his peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, when the mother of this Babylon was to be razed, Ier. 51.45. And this commandement shal not be made in vaine to his people, to whom alone it is proper to obey his voice. Therfore even as the miſes perceaving before hand that the houſe will fall, doo runne away out of their holes,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:6819:311"/> ſo they being wakened out of ſleep by the Angels voice, shal convey them ſelves by and by out of this deteſtable city.</p>

But if through the whole Papiſtical Kingdome, Rome be the holy city, Peters chaire, which cannot erre, this chained row hath ſuffered a great interruption: which as it much exceedeth the ages of the Heathen Emperours, ſo much the more eaſily it dooth blot out the impietie of that three yeeres ſpace of Antichriſt, which they dreame is yet to come, although it were granted, that he should raign at Rome. How can the ſinnes in the laſt times come up even to heaven, from whoſe full heape ſo much is taken away by ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g continuing holines of the Popes? But this Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath made the thing manifeſt, declaring that the Pope received a lampe from the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours, and to have heaped up new ſinnes upon the former heape in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinual row; even as the perpetual order and ſucceſsion of Popes sheweth; for which onely thing the catalogue of the Popes ſerveth greatly. We hav ſeen this heape wonderfully increaſed in theſe our times: neither shal they which folow, leſſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully add to the heape, until they have both brought their ſinns unto heaven, and alſo their wicked citie to duſt. The Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aretas tranſlateth <hi>have cleaved to;</hi> Montanus, <hi>are glued togither,</hi> one layed on an other, and as it were ſoldered with glue. Therfore the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Rome shal be made yet more manifeſt to the elect, to the end that they may thinke the more in earneſt of flying from her.</p>

But theſe things declare the event, to weet, that men shal uſe verie great ſeveritie in executing this laſt deſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And it is to be obſerved that the citizens now of the Romane juriſdiction ſhal
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:6819:311"/> be the Miniſters of this univerſal ſlaughter. For whom the Angel eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now commanded to come out of Babylon, them he now exhorteth to reve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is like that theſe being mindful of ſo long continuing tyranny, wherwith they have lyen oppreſſed ſo many ages, and having alſo the late iniuries fixed in their minds, the ſting wherof dooth yet greeve them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, wil more freely give licence to their anger, and wil ſatiſfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſcarce with anie punishment.

Neither are theſe proude words darke, when shee chalengeth to her ſelfe a Primacy over all Churches, braggeth that shee is the head of Chriſtianity; the beginning of eternal life, and many other things of like blaſphemous arrogancy. Which Primacy shee aſſureth her ſelfe shalbe for ever, perſwading her owne heart that she shal never be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prived of this dignity, neither shal have experience of anie calamity. For what other thing is it that her moſt beloved ſonnes doo avouch that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire cannot be ſeparated from Rome, nor the ſeate of the Apoſtles tranſlated from thence, as Bellarmine affirmeth in his 4. book of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome chap. 4. Which although he wil not have to be counted among the articles of the faith, yet it ſeemeth to him by ſome arguments of ſo great ſtrength, that at the laſt he can hadly pe perſuaded, but that it is an article of the Papiſts faith. Francis de Ribera now geſſeth that ſom evil shal happen to Rome, but after that manner, that he sheweth rather his care, then giveth over even the leaſt that may be of his bragging.</p>

Moreover after the time is finished of giving their Kingdome to the Beaſt, the ten hornes with a conſtant minde shal deteſt the whore, ſo farr off is it that they shal be greeved for her miſerable condition, chap. 17.16.17. Therfore that device falleth down concerning the ten Kings, in whoſe power shalbe the dominion of the whole earth, who, if with ioyned forces (as the Ieſuite wil have it) they shal bring the laſt deſtruction upon Rome, they should leave no King to bewayle her great miſerie.

Therfore although the names of the countries ar not expreſſed in plain words, as in Ezechiel; yet notwithſtanding they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be underſtood according to that rule, from the wares themſelves. The wares therfore of Gold, and ſilver, and the other outlandiſh things, which are rehearſed in this verſe, may ſignify Spayne, which fetched thoſe things from the furdeſt Indies, by whoſe travel they are to be ſold in this part of the world. <hi>Cinnamon, Odours, Ointments, Frankincenſe</hi> &amp; <hi>wine</hi> doo note out Italy; not becauſe all theſe things doo grow in the ſame place, but becauſe as Spaine by the Ocean Sea; ſo this by the intern ſea affoardeth abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe things to Europe from Greece, Cilicia, Aegypt, Africk.

Ambroſius Catharinus sheweth this plainly in his book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Luther, whom that moſt fooliſh Aſſe calleth a Beaſt, almoſt in every verſe: and that not ſo much for hatred of his Hereſy (as he calleth it,) as with a manifeſt reproch of the whole nation. Rome indeed ſpeaketh mor modeſtly at this time, not daring to provoke the fierceneſſe of men by ſo greate a contumely: but ſecretly with her ſelfe she iudgeth no otherweiſe then before time; and not onely of this people alone, but of al other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Europe: all which, her ſelfe onely excepted, shee accounteth almoſt meere brutes. But God hath choſen this fooliſhnes, if thou wilt ſo hav it, of our nations, wherby he might throw to the ground thy vaine wiſdom, and at length by thy iuſt puniſhment, might ſet forth thy pride to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all men.</p>

Rome hath now a long time veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly grieved, that theſe wares are brought ſparing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to her faires; and therfore tryed everie way, that she may enioy the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them. For this purpoſe she maintaineth Engliſh youth, and hath made Alan our countrey man a Cardinal. She fitteth for her ſelf theſe merchants, beſides troupes of Ieſuits, if peradventure she may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine Lord of our ſheepe. But we, thankes be to God, know for a ſurety, that Rome is a denn of wolves, and other moſt cruel Beaſts. Let her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as ſweetly and pleaſantly as shee can, we acknowledge her voice to be of ſtrangers and robbers; neither wil we be taken with the ſweetneſſe therof.

               <p n="21">21 <hi>Then a certain Angel tooke up:</hi> Hitherto hath bin declared the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>by words onely;</hi> now a <hi>ſigne</hi> likeweiſe is uſed, wherby it may be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it shalbe ſudden and eternal. And this is done by the miniſtery of a certain third Angel; of whom there is no mention made from whence he came: peradventure becauſe he is that firſt, whoſe place from whence he came is shewed in ver. 1: who now is brought in againe to performe that very thing, which thar preparation ſaid, would come by and by. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this caſting of a milſtone into the ſea, be the very overthrowing of Rome, it is not deſcribed by what way it shalbe done. In the beginning of the chapter following, we shal underſtand that the thing is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. And the former Angels went but a litle before the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either now is handled the ſame <hi>overthrow,</hi> or he wholly concealeth how it should be performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ A milſtone caſt into the ſea:</hi> may be a fit ſigne of the ruine, as the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mountaine caſt into the ſea, was of the beginning of Antichriſtian ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ranny, chap. 8.8. But yet the thing is darke to us. The event wil manifeſt it at length. This Angel is caled <hi>ſtrong,</hi> taking up a ſtone like a milſtone, &amp; caſting it into the ſea: for by ſo many degrees is the type propoſed. Which things declare an admirable ſwiftneſſe of this ruine, and no more repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. A great ſtone by his waightineſſe falleth down with a great viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: yet with a greater if it be caſt: but with much more being thrown of ſome valiant and ſtrong man. Neither is ther hope, that that shal flote againe in the toppe, which both his owne weight, and outward force, have faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the loweſt bottome So shal Babylon be caſt with violence, neither shall it be found any more, Yet theſe things are not ſpoken ſo, as if hee were to be taken at the firſt aſſault, which before we have shewed by a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bable reaſon, shalbe beſieged for ſome ſpace: even as alſo the old Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon came not into Cyrus power, but after ſome long delay: but becauſe after it hath bin taken, and begun to be ſpoiled, very quickly shall her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be finished. It may be that this type may ſignify the manner of taking Rome, which we know was uſed in Babylon. Of right is the type one, of them both, whoſe impiety is alike; and like alſo shalbe the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Ier. 51.63.64.</p>

But al be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to mirth, as we learne from Ieremy, from whom theſe things are fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: from whence it would be a thing unpleaſant and abſurd to deale with the Ieſuite any further <hi>about mourning pipes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Nor any crafts man:</hi> After thoſe things of delectation, he rehearſeth the things which appertaine neerer to the life: of which there is a more ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſary uſe, as of craftſmen and milles. Where there is any ſociety of men, it is needfull that artificers be in the ſame place: but chiefly it behooveth that there be ſufficient victuals, which the <hi>milles</hi> doo note out, without which no man can continue ſcarce for one day. Behold whither at length our riot hath brought us, procuring alſo deſtruction to thoſe inſtruments which we have abuſed to vanity and naughtines: not leaving any commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> food there, where gluttony and bellycheere onely were regarded.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>And the light of a candle:</hi> Candles are a confort in the night, the uſe wherof no man will want, although he be of a moſt poore condition. But thou wilt ſay, what great dammage can be in the loſſe of things of ſo ſmal price? Such ſmal matters moſt fitly deſcribe the greatneſſe of the evill. For if things moſt common and of moſt frequent uſe are lacking, any ſtore of things of ſome moment, is not to be expected: unleſſe peradventure the <hi>candles</hi> are to be referred to the bridgroome and bride, which follow. They were wonte to be uſed ſolemly in marriages. From whence is the parable of the tenne Virgins <hi>which came forth with their lampes to meet the bridgroome,</hi> Mat. 25.1. Doubtleſſe Chriſt borroweth the ſimilitude from a thing in comm uſage and cuſtome. Children in time paſt were called <hi>ſcotioi,</hi> which were born <hi>ek ton adadouketon gamon,</hi> from marriages, in which no torches were caried before them, as the Interpr. of Homer hath obſerved, Iliad. <hi>E.</hi> It was alſo a cuſtome amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Romanes, for a boy that had Father and mother living, to beare before the ſpouſe, a torch of a white thorne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were married in the night, as Plutarche ſaith in his Problemes. But that is clear which is added concerning the bridgroome &amp; the bride,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:6819:318"/> to weet, that this calamity shal not lie upon her onely for ſome time, but that ther shal be no hope of anie better eſtate in time to come. This is it which the voice of the bridegroome and bride meaneth, as though he should ſay, never shal any marriages be contracted here, wherby should be made an increaſing of poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For thy marchants were the great men of the earth:</hi> Here the ſinnes of the city are rehearſed to be three; Luxurie, Idolatry, and the murder of the ſaincts. Her riot appeareth, becauſe they that ſerve her luſt are made the great men of the earth. It muſt needs be that her exceſſe in pleaſures is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked, whoſe ſervants are advanced unto ſo great dignity. Wee have shewed before that this is a marchandiſe <hi>of ſoules,</hi> and that theſe marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are the Lords <hi>Cardinals.</hi> Which who ſeeth and acknowledgeth not to be theſe great men, manifeſt demonſtrations of the Romiſh luxurie? Thomas Wolſey our countreyman in often ſpeach was not ashamed to ſay, <hi>I and my King.</hi> Such a Cardinalship is pride. But why may they not vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo proudly, when they shal ſee great Princes to ſue for this their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity, or at the leaſt to glory no leſſe in the ſame being given them, then in the chiefe ornament of maieſty? There have bin many of old eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Kings ſtocke, who judged this degree; not unworthy the nobleneſſe of their race. VVith us in Queene Maryes dayes was Cardinal Poole of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cely linage. Among the Franch of late Cardinal Borbon of the blood roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and of Lorrrain, brother of the Duke of Guiſe. Albert of Auſtriche yet flourisheth, but yeſterday a Cardinal, and brother of Rodulphe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Is not this in very truth a great dignity, which ſo great Princes doo not refuſe? May they not of right be called <hi>the great men of the earth,</hi> which are placed in ſo high a top of honour? But thou wilt ſay it yet more if thou shalt ſee the aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly of the ſtately Lords ſitting togither at Rome. Let ſome Prince come, whom the Pope for honours ſake wil receive into the company of the Cardinals, what place hath he aſsigned for him? To weet, before the laſt Cardinal Deacon, ſo as if there shalbe a great and ful ſenate, the Prince himſelfe after three ſcore &amp; eight men cloathed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple garments, shal ſit the laſt ſave one, as of late in the yeere 1593. Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian the Prince of Bavarie. This is that intolerable pride, yet meet for the Romish court; where even Emperours kiſſe the feete of the Pope: why should not the Conſellers of this Prelate, excell other Princes in dignity? But at length this pride shal cal forth that low eſtate, wherby Rome shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be preſſed downe even to Hell. It is manifeſt ynough from the foreſaid things, how from this fountaine, Idolatry hath flowen into all the VVeſt part. Neither is ther any need of moe words concerning the <hi>murders of the
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:6819:318"/> Saincts,</hi> which wee have touched before; neither is ther any man to whom they are not moſt certainly known.</p>

This one word containeth large matter of very great ioy. But why doth the heavenly multitude ſpeake now in Hebrew? Is ther more holineſſe in theſe lettres and ſyllables than in other? They ar toyes.

                  <hi>¶ Salvation, and honour, and glory:</hi> That is the prayſe of ſalvation, honour, and glory, and praiſe of power be given to our Lord. <hi>Glory</hi> is a certaine very excellent opinion which a man hath of any ones excellency, therfore called of the Grecians <hi>doxa.</hi> Wherfore in this deſtruction of Rome ſo bright a beame of Gods goodnes and power shal shine forth, that al the faithful shal admire it, and be aſtonied. <hi>Honour</hi> is that worship both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, wherby we doo reverence ſo great excellency. It is &amp; ought alwaies to be ioyned with <hi>glory:</hi> otherweiſe vaine is that eſtimation of one, which no dutie accompanieth: the vulgar latine readeth, <hi>prayſe, &amp; glory, and powr, be to our God:</hi> The Complut. and the Kings Bible have, <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and power, and glory of our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Becauſe true and righteous:</hi> The truth in iudgments reſpecteth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: righteouſnes rewarding according to their deſerts. The credit of both theſe falleth into utter decay with the world becauſe of delaying: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence now for good cauſe God is praiſed of his people in both theſe reſpects; wheras he hath proved ſufficiently to the world, that he dooth puniſh naughty acts, and that he neglecteth not the iniuries which are done to his.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:6819:320"/>3 <hi>And againe they ſaid:</hi> An other thankes giving, the thing being more certenly known. The firſt tidings of the taking of the city, shal cauſe the <hi>firſt,</hi> as it ſeemeth; but when the faithful shal have learned that the ſame is utterly overthrown, without al hope of renewing, they shal renew their ioy, and shal give new thankes a freſh. <hi>The ſecond</hi> is done in fewer words than the former: peradventure according to our diſpoſition, whoſe firſt brunt is moſt vehement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And her ſmoke roſe up:</hi> That is, now is ſhee delivered up to eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to be tormented. For an everlaſting fyre is shewed <hi>by the ſmoke aſcending for evermore:</hi> by which kind of ſpeaking is ſignifyed, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual remembrance of her punishment shalbe with al the godly alwayes. A token wherof they shal have continually before their eyes, the ſmoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending without intermiſsion, leaſt perhaps they should forget it. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth to the eternal torment of the wicked. Therfore the eternity of the punishment shal give a new cauſe of gladneſſe. And not without cauſe, when they knowe that the inſolency of the wicked whore, shal not onely be reſtrained for the preſent, but alſo that none shal have any feare of her for the time to come.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And thoſe fowr and twenty Elders fell down:</hi> Such was the reioycing of the <hi>mixed multitude,</hi> ther followeth the aſſembly of the <hi>faithfull</hi> gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither ſolemly, which doo labour openly and ioyntly to the ſame duty of thankes giving. For this multitude of Elders and Beaſts giveth a shew of an Eccleſiaſtical aſſembly: which God the Father, for his ſonnes ſake cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſuch, as this moſt holy company repreſenteth. And therfore, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as any thing is performed by a common name, that is shewed by this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Senat, as we have shewed in chap. 4. Such therfore shalbe the order of giving thankes, that the end and concluſion of the common thankes giving, be reſerved to the publike congregations. And ſo it hath come to paſſe, that private reioycing alwayes goeth before the common &amp; publik. Any blaſt of report is wont to ſtirr up that firſt: this is not undertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but when the things are throughly known and undoubted. But the foure and twenty Elders fall down, when the Beaſts give glory and thankes to him that ſitteth on the throne. It belongeth to theſe to moderate the whole action in the publike aſſembly; the reſt of the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to ioine their praiers, and to teſtify their conſent by a common voyce in the ende. According to this cuſtome there are rehearſed here onely two words, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Allelujah.</hi> As though that former were <hi>of the Elders;</hi> this latter, the ſumme of the thankes giving which the <hi>Beaſts</hi> utter in conceived words. But this order hath bin declared more fully in chap. 4. from whence this
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:6819:321"/> ought to be underſtood the ſame; which now is shewed briefly. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the laſt ſongs of the Church of the Gentiles shalbe gratulatory, which yeeld no other ſong then <hi>Halleluiah.</hi> Even as the book of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes is concluded with ſongs of praiſes. Shee ſunge in time paſt many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſongs, and hymnes of a mixt kinde, but the laſt part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy shalbe doubtleſſe a moſt joyful tryumph. And theſe are the funerals of the city of Rome, and the rites by which her burial shalbe celebrated. The day and yeere cannot certenly be ſet downe, in which her funeralls shalbe: yet from other ſcriptures I think it to be clear, that they shall not be differred at the furdeſt, beyond three ſcore yeeres The ſixeteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter hath taught, that next after that the vial is powred out upon the thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, <hi>Euphsates</hi> shalbe dryed up, that is, after Rome deſtroyed, the Iewes shalbe converted. And other places ſeeme to confirme, that their firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling shalbe about the fiftieth yeere above one thouſand ſixe hundreth. But how much Rome preventeth that time, it is uncertain: it is like, but a very litle, conſidering that the chooſing of a new people followeth it at the heeles. We have ſeen how farr the vials have proceeded. The next is now to be powred out on the <hi>Sunne,</hi> which is shortly to be expected: by the heate wherof, after Rome hath bin very hot a short ſpace, shee ſhall approch the flamme of fyre by the fift vial, which ſhal burn her altogither; then the throne shalbe deſtroyed, and this gratulation prepared for the godly. Doeſt thou then, ô Rome, keepe now a yeere of Iubilé, when thy funerall rather were to be provided for? In very deed, within the ſpace of one Iubilé, that is, about fifty yeres hence, thou shalt keepe Iubilé in truth, not ſo much thy ſelfe by reioycing, as by giving occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of exceeding great ioy to al the ſaincts by thy deſtruction. Doeſt thou then with Balthaſſar, abandon thy ſelfe to eatings and drinkings, Cyrus compaſsing abou thy walls, and being already entred into the chanell of Euphrates, which is turned aſide? I know that the admonition of an Heretique (as thou will have mee to be,) with thee is of no force; but conſider diligently the man or the thing it ſelf, if hatred wil ſuffer thee, leaſt peradventure, whom thou counteſt an Heretique, thou finde him too late a true Prophet: yet if thou deſpiſe my voyce, let the holy remnant here, if any lie hid in thee. Awake yee elect, come yee out, make haſt to flee away, yee have lyen too long in the bedds of Sodome, a showre of brimſtone will fall by and by, unleſſe yee depart quickly, you cannot be ſafe. Obey the Spirit, who would have you to be warned by this ſacred Revelation. Why doo yee hange upon this purpled company, whoſe eyes God hath blinded by his iuſt iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? If my admonition shal have place with you, yee shal refreſh greatly the
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:6819:321"/> mindes of the brethren, but the fruit shalbe your owne, to weet the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of ſoules and bodyes.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Then a voice came out from the throne:</hi> Hitherto the fift vial; now the ſixt is handled. For this exhortation belongeth to new praiſes, not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Babylon. For to what end should ther be a commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againe touching this thing, and a new triumph? Therfore now it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how the <hi>waters of Euphrates ſhalbe dryed up.</hi> This folowed next the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the throne chap. 16.12. Becauſe the great river shalbe turned into drie ground, from hence we learne that nothing should be a let to the gueſts, or rather to the new bride, as is plainly confirmed in verſe 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Becauſe the marriage of the Lambe is come:</hi> Which ſurely was the reaſon why wee hav interpreted that ſixt vial, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the calling of the Iewes. Firſt therfore the efficient cauſe of this calling is ſet forth, a voice <hi>coming forth from the throne.</hi> Which yet is not of the Father himſelfe, but of the Sonne, as it is cleare from that which followeth, <hi>praiſe yee our God. It came out of the throne,</hi> becauſe the Sonne shal effect this wonderfull thing rather by his own power, than by any aide of man. He shal take to himſelf alone the duties of this thing, and shal performe all wholly by himſelfe. VVhich way alſo otherweiſe, should the Eaſterne Iewes beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Euphrates firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the faith, which are furtheſt off from hearing of the Goſpel? Yet no ſound thundring from heaven is to be expected; but this voice is the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Spirit, whom God now shall ſend into the harts of his people, that being turned to him with all their harts, they may acknowledge, praiſe, and celebrate the one onely true God, his Sonne Ieſus, and the H. Ghoſt. <hi>Now God powreth upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitans of Ieruſalem the Spirit of grace, and of prayer,</hi> Zach. 12.10. <hi>Now he wil build the Virgin of Iſrael, and ſhal adorne her ſelfe with her timbrels, and ſhal goe before in the dance of them that praiſe; now he ſhal ſay, reioyce with gladneſſe for Iacob, &amp; ſhowt for ioy openly before the very Gentils: publiſh, prayſe, and ſay, ſave o Lord thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, the remnant of Iſrael.</hi> Iere. 31.4.7. But it is to be obſerved how this calling is ioyned togither with the deſtruction of Rome. It is ſevered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it by no other tranſition, but as riſing from thence forthwith from her fall, becometh cleare to the world. <hi>The Temple was full of ſmoke that no man could enter in, untill God had ſatiſfyed his anger upon the whore;</hi> but after he hath punished her according to her deſerts, then as it were with a quiet minde, he shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vert himſelfe wholly to accomplish the ſalvation of all his elect, and to receiv againe his people ſent away from him by ſo longue a baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. VVherfore if we have kept a true account of this calling, we ſhall not wander much from the laſt deſtruction of Rome.</p>
               <pb n="628" facs="tcp:6819:322"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Praiſe yee our God:</hi> No man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiſe God, but he that knoweth him, neither al generally, but the whole multitude of the elect on earth, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the knowledge of God, may conſent to praiſe him. Therfore this provocation declareth that calling, and the ſame general, when as al are bidden to praiſe, both univerſally, and particularly, as well the ſmal of the Iewes, who becauſe of their new comming to the faith, might ſeeme at that time to have bin ſcarce borne; as alſo the great of the Gentils, who being more growen in Chriſt, have obtained a ful maturity by a long pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſsion, who shal praiſe God for their brethrens converſion, <hi>when they ſhal ſee that which hath not bin told them,</hi> and <hi>ſhal underſtand that which they hav not heard,</hi> Iſay 52.14. But the Iewes themſelves then with ioyful &amp; glad minds, shal heare, that favour at length is shewed them; that their eyes are opened for to know the truth, that they are reduced againe, built, mul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiplyed, &amp; ſtablished more then before time, ſo as they shal ſatiſfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with no praiſes. <hi>Then,</hi> faith Ieremy, <hi>ſhal proceed out of them voice of thankes giving, and the voice of them that laugh, then ſhal the virgin reioice in the dance, the yong men and old men togither,</hi> chap. 30 19. and 31.13. and many the like things, perteining to the ioyfulnes of that moſt pleaſant time.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>And I heard as it were a ſound:</hi> The voice of a new people converted to Chriſt, and praiſing God for this unexpected bounteouſnes. This is an exceeding great voice, by reaſon of the multitude of the people; then alſo <hi>making a noiſe</hi> in the beginning by obſcure reports, and more eaſy to be un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtood what it meaneth, then the noiſe of waters roaring confuſedly, which yet notwithſtanding a while after ſhalbe terrible, and apaling like thunder. It may be doubtful, whither this be the voice of the Gentiles, as it were the friends of the bridegroome, or of the Iewes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves who embrace the calling. The Gentiles had learned before to found <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah.</hi> And now he biddeth them ſpeake to their brethren, and to ſtirre up them by a new ſhoute. Alſo the next verſe folowing declareth the exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of friends reioycing in their behalfe. But this terrible voice, as it were of waters and thunders, ſeemeth to belong to the Iewes. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it may be the ioint voice of both peoples. Whoſe ſoever it is, either of the one, or of both, we underſtand from hence an effectual calling. But the voice calleth them <hi>to praiſe God,</hi> becauſe now he hath obtained his <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.</hi> Chriſt hath alwaies ruled: but the glory of his Kingdome shal then flourish moſt clearly, which in former times, partly the infidelity of the Iewes, partly the tyranny of the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Beaſt did much obſcure. <hi>Now a ſtone hewen out of the mountaine without hands ſhal reigne, which Kingdome ſhal not be deſtroied for ever, neither be leſt to an other people.</hi> Dan. 2.44. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:6819:322"/> mention of <hi>Gods omnipotency</hi> in getting this Kingdome, wherby in ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry truth he declared himſelfe moſt mighty in deſtroying the enemies, who with al their ſtrength, wil reſiſt this Kingdome when it beginneth.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Let us be glad and reioyce:</hi> So the freinds of the bridegroome ſeeme to provoke one an other to joy. Let us, ſay they, adorne ourſelves moſt gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly, as it is wont to be done in triumphs and feſtival dayes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reioycing. And it is a thing indeed very greatly to be triumphed for, to underſtand that brethren divided from us by ſo lamentable a divorce, ſo many ages, are now at length choſen into the ſame body of Chriſt with us. Of which ioy the Prophets ſpake many excellent things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Becauſe the marriage is come:</hi> For as the former comming was called <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mos</hi> a <hi>marriage,</hi> Mat. 22.2. wherby Chriſt ioyned to himſelfe the Gentils, and took them into the marriage bed: ſo likeweiſe much more shalbe the time of marriage, when he shal draw the Iewes, whom firſt he woed, to his love, and company: from whence it is not without cauſe, that in the ſame place it is ſaid, <hi>he made marriages for his Sonne,</hi> not one, but moe; the former at his firſt comming; the ſecond at this calling of the Iewes. Which is more evident in the Greeke, where <hi>gamos,</hi> marriage, is uſed in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar number. The Latines call every particular marriage, <hi>nuptias,</hi> marriages in the plural number.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And his wife hath made her ſelfe ready:</hi> Both ſiſters, as wel the Gentils, as the Iewes, make one wife, being married to the ſame bridegroome, as once Leah and Rachell to Iacob. Leah indeede more deformed, to weet, wee Gentils have entred firſt into the company of the bedde, and became alſo farre more fruitfull; but the choſen and faire Rachell, the people of the Iewes, shal at length alſo be brought into the bed chamber, and ſhall become a mother of moſt ſweet children.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>And to her was graunted:</hi> To weet, the new bride, which of late was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither void of this apparell. The Church of the Gentiles was moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in her firſt beginning. A <hi>crowne of twelve ſtarrs</hi> adorned her head, &amp; all the reſidue of her was clothed with the Sunne, chap. 12.1. Therfore this fine linnen is not provided for her: but to that other, which before time lay ilfavoured, foule, naked, not covered ſo much as with ragges, theſe fine linnen garments are given, wherby shee may hide her deformed nakedneſſe. And this fine linnen is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> made ours for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſalvation by imputation: which garment the Iewes wanted, while refuſing Chriſt and his righteouſnes, they went about to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſnes: but at length being graffed in by faith, they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their former hope, &amp; shal embrace this ſalvation, clad with this
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:6819:323"/> glorious garment onely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ That ſhee ſhould be arrayed with pure fine linnen, and ſhining:</hi> He ſaith not, <hi>fine linnen was given unto her,</hi> but, <hi>to her was granted, that ſhee ſhould be arrayed with fine linnen &amp;c.</hi> This is the difference, becauſe in that former is ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that fine linnen is given immediately; in this, mediately by faith. This fine linnen is <hi>pure and ſhining: pure,</hi> in reſpect of iuſtification, becauſe it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth us unblameable and without fault, free from all ſpotte &amp; blemiſh: <hi>ſhining,</hi> in reſpect of glory, both with God, who becauſe of this purity in his Sonne, maketh us heires of his eternal Kingdome; and alſo with men, to whom it manifeſteth our adoption by her moſt ſhining fruits, which the Spirit working togither with us, maketh manifeſt unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For the fine linnen is the righteouſneſſes of the Saincts:</hi> Behold how diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plaiynly the Spirit ſpeaketh: for he ſaith not that <hi>the righteouſneſſes of the Saincts are fine linnen,</hi> but contrariweiſe that <hi>the fine linnen is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſes;</hi> neither <hi>of the wicked,</hi> as when a man is firſt converted to God, but, <hi>of the Saincts:</hi> that is, the wholle iuſtification, yee even of thoſe whoſe pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth moſt of all shew it ſelfe, commeth not from themſelves, and from things ingraffed, but abideth without in the outward garment, to weet of Chriſt, whom we put on by faith onely. A moſt plaine ſcripture, which, ô yee Papiſts, conſider diligently, that your blaſphemous pride being at length reiected, yee may ſeeke true ſalvation from thence, from whence alone it may be obtained. Doo yee thruſt upon God the merits of the Saincts? Away with thoſe polluted garments, the fine linnen given, is our iuſtifications: the clothing is not made of our vertues, wherby wee may be able to ſtand before God. No ſimilitude dooth ſet more clearly befor our eyes the imputation of righteouſnes by faith, then this garment uſed ſo often in the Scriptures. But why, wilt thou ſay, doth he ſay <hi>iuſtifications</hi> rather then <hi>iuſtification?</hi> not to deſtroy the onely righteouſnes of faith, but ſeing <hi>dikaioma, iuſtification</hi> is a proofe wherby a man sheweth himſelfe to be iuſt, as chap. 15.4. And there is a double argument to this purpoſe, one before God by faith, in which reſpect <hi>Chriſt is the white fine linnen of the Saincts,</hi> chap. 7.13.14. Another before men, by the works of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in regard of this double argument the Spirit ſaith <hi>iuſtifications,</hi> that he may containe in one word, that which even now he declared by two, <hi>pure and ſhining.</hi> For the works of holines, if they be taken aſunder, ar not <hi>pure;</hi> or if faith be conſidered by it ſelfe, it is not <hi>ſhining.</hi> For it lyeth hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within, farre from the eies of men. Neither of both therfore apart can be called <hi>iuſtifications,</hi> both are to be ioyned togither, to expreſſe the force of the multitude. And to whom this fine linnen is given, both are found in
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:6819:323"/> them.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Then he ſaid unto me write:</hi> Who ſaid? Not he that ſate upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the throne. For the Elders worshipped him, ver. 4. This, it was not lawful, being the felow ſervant of Iohn. Therfore it is ſome Angel, to whom were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the charge of ſealing this Prophecy. Firſt therfore he biddeth him w<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: by which ſo ſolemne commandement he teacheth that there is in it a great and ſtrange matter. We commit to writing things, the credit wher of we will have to be confirmed unto all poſterity: for which cauſe, lawes were graven once in Braſſe, and ſet up in a publike place. Alſo God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Ieremy concerning this ſame thing; <hi>Write,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for thy ſelfe all the words which I ſpeake unto thee, in a book,</hi> chap. 30.2. As if God providing for our infirmity, should give us ſealed writings, from which wee might cal upon him for helpe more freely and boldly, if peradventure he should ſeem to forget his promiſe. But not onely Iohn is confirmed hereby, but alſo the event is reſpected, as we have ſeen from the like places before: as if it should come to paſſe that by the authority of ſome holy man, ſome pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blike writing should be ſet forth, which moſt plainly should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme this thing not to be new, but foreshewed of God from the furtheſt times, and that therfore the goodneſſe and truth of God is to be acknowledged and praiſed in the ſame. But the time wil manifeſt, what at length is to be thought concerning this matter. But what is it which he is commanded to write? <hi>That they are bleſſed which ar called to the marriage ſupper of the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be;</hi> a thing indeed wonderful &amp; never heard off before, that al should be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed which are called. Before time this rule was in force; <hi>many are called, few choſen:</hi> which thing example alſo hath prooved true, when the calling fell not out proſperouſly to the auncient gheſts, who being called refuſed to come. But now it shalbe otherweiſe. Al the called shal come gladly, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shal alledge for their excuſe things of ſmal importance, as did thoſe former, Mat. 22. So great now shalbe the efficacy and grace of the Spirit, that they shal obey at the firſt hearing. <hi>Before,</hi> ſaith Iſaiah, <hi>ſhee travailed, ſhe brought forth, and before her paine came, ſhee was delivered of a man childe. Who hath heard ſuch a thing? Who hath ſeen ſuch things? Shal the earth be brought forth in one day? Or ſhall a nation be borne at once? For aſſoone as Zion travailed, ſhee brought forth her children &amp;c.</hi> So Pſal. 110.3. <hi>Thy people moſt voluntary of all men in the time of thine armies in the beautiful places of thy holineſſe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wombe of the mourning, ſhalbe to thee dewe of thy youth.</hi> Many ſuch things might be brought, and peradventure it would be profitable; at leaſt weiſe that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion might be given to our men to conſider diligently of thoſe places: from the true meaning wherof I feare that wee erre, by interpreting the

This ſentence therfore, which is commaunded to be written, taketh away al ſcruple fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iohn. He might have minded the former obſtinacy of the nation, and for that cauſe have doubted of their converſion. But the Angel commandeth this care to depart. There shalbe ſo great diligence of the people, that it shalbe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them to be called away. It is to be obſerved, that the Iewes both here and elſewhere in many places, are called <hi>keclemenous</hi> in the preterper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tence, by a certain prerogative of calling, as it ſeemeth, as who were called ever ſince the firſt times of the world.

                  <hi>¶ Theſe words are true:</hi> The ſecond confirmation taken from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal authour, as though he should ſay, reſpect not mee, as reporting any thing of mine owne, but be ſo perſwaded, that this is the decree of the moſt High God, as thou thy ſelfe heardeſt even now with thyne own ears, ver. 5. but the natural placing of the words hath an emphaſis, as it is in the Greek, which by the diſplacing is loſt; <hi>theſe are the true words of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> that is, of moſt divine, moſt excellent, and moſt certen truth. True are alſo ſome words of men, but there is ſome infirmity in our moſt true things. Wee alwayes ſpeake from the earth, Iohn 3.31. Therfore ſome preferment is attributed to this truth, which appeareth not, if we change the order of the words. It is no ſtrange thing, that the <hi>words of God should be true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>And I fell down before his feet;</hi> VVhy now more then before? VVas he abaſhed with the maieſty of the Angel? But he had bin accuſtomed now a long time to wonderful ſights. Or was it for ioy of the converſion of his nation? ſo in deed it ſeemeth. For Iohn being ravished, as it is clear fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the anſwer of the Angel, with the ſweetneſſe of this Prophecy, for ſudden ioy, wherwith he was carried away, would give more worſhip then was meet, to ſo welcome a meſſenger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ See that not:</hi> to weet, that thou worship mee not, a defective ſpeach, noting out the grievouſneſſe of the naughty act: for he maketh ſpeed, and finisheth not the ſentence for haſt. Even as wee are wont to prohibit a thing, eyther by ſudden crying out, or by the hand, when the thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not any time for words. He confirmeth the prohibition by two reaſons: firſt from the equal dignity of the Miniſters of Chriſt: <hi>J am,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:6819:324"/> he, <hi>thy felow ſervant,</hi> and not onely of the Apoſtles, but alſo of thy brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which have the teſtimony of Ieſu. Al our office is equal: they who preach Chriſt, &amp; ſalvation by him, are in equal dignity with them, which reveale things to come. The office of preaching is equal to the office of revealing: this is the meaning of that which is ſaid in the ende of the verſe. <hi>For the teſtimony of Ieſu is the Spirit of Prophecy.</hi> The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration belongeth to God onely; <hi>Worship him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to whom alone ſuch worship is due.</hi> Doo not ye, ô Popiſh Idolaters, tremble at theſe words? Ye take great paines about deviſing reaſons, why the Angel prohibited adoration, as though he himſelfe hath not rendred moſt cleare ones in his own words. But what reaſons bring yee? To weet, that after our fleſh taken of Chriſt, the Angels are greatly afraid to ſee the ſame proſtrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as Gregory the Great wil have it. Moreover becauſe, beſide this dignity, men are alſo Miniſters of Chriſt, Prophets, and meſſengers of the Evangelical doctrine, and Martyrs for the ſame. Be it ſo, doo ye not perceive that you are killed with your owne ſwords? If they feare much to ſee our nature proſtrate to them, after the ſame taken of Chriſt; why do ye caſt down your nature to ſtones, and painted Images, and put the holy Angels in feare? If they wil not be worshipped of the Miniſters of Chriſt, either at length, ceaſe to doo wickedly, or at leaſt confeſſe your ſelves not to be Miniſters of Chriſt. And in this weiſe is the firſt calling of the Iewes, that shalbe now shortly, which Daniel deſcribeth by a certen pointing out of the time, chap. 12.12. &amp; c, Ezechiel ſaw it shadowed out by the dry bones, moving themſelves with an exceeding great noiſe, &amp; ſhaking, and by and after covered with ſinewes &amp; flesh. chap. 37.78. as wee shal heare afterward, God willing more fully.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Then J ſaw heaven open:</hi> It being declared how Euphrates muſt be dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed up, or rather to what ende, that is to ſay, that nothing may be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to the Iewes returning into their owne countrey, now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to the other part of the ſixt vial, the preparation for warre, the Captaine wherof is firſt deſcribed. And ſuch a forme of him is exhibited not onely as is needful for this warre, but alſo which declareth the whole ſtate of things from that inſtant moment, even to the end of al things. It is no new thing, that under the perſon of Chriſt, a short and brief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the whole ſtate of his ſpouſe should be delivered. He is not cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; unleſſe in ſo much as it is convenient for his Church. Therfore in this new shape as in a glaſſe, we ought to behold the face of the ſpouſe, by how much it is to be conſidered the more diligently. This wonderfull ſight is ſeen in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> open, that is, in the holy Church, whoſe moſt bright
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:6819:325"/> glory now moſt of all ſhalbe made manifeſt to al men, as before by a dore open in heaven, the notable dignity and excellency of the firſt Church, as it was in the Apoſtles daies, and by and by after, chap. 4.1. But this is more ample glory, that heaven is opened not by ſome little dore, but by a whole gate; ye whole walles, that I may ſo ſay, nothing letting but that her full maieſty now may be ſeen of men, as farre as is granted on earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And behold a white horſe:</hi> We may not ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſhal come forth in any viſible ſhape; theſe things are farre from his laſt comming, as thoſe things which follow wil manifeſt; but he wil shew forth openly and evidently ſuch a force in the adminiſtration of things, as this figure repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth. The whole deſcription conſiſteth of foure parts. In every one of which is to be conſidered the <hi>preparation and name.</hi> In this firſt part the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing is <hi>a white horſe,</hi> the name <hi>faithful and true.</hi> The ſimilitude of which things, with that in chap. 6.2. hath cauſed that ſome did thinke this to be the ſame viſion, by which errour they confound all things. They differ much in times, and in argument. That <hi>white horſe belonge to the firſt liſts.</hi> But this to the laſt goale. That former went forth by and by after Iohn, when Traiane flourished, and his next ſucceſſours. This laſt is not ſeen but after the deſtruction of Rome. There, the confuſed multitude of all the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was reſpected. Here, the converſion of the nation of the Iewes onely is intreated off. Yet herin they agree, that the white horſe in both places ſignifyeth Chriſt triumphing by his truth; but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Gentiles being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; now at length a ſtubburne people being reconciled unto him. To which thing he carried a name fitted: wherby he sheweth, that he wil now at laſt manifeſt to the whole world how <hi>faithfull &amp; true he is,</hi> in performing his promiſes; and that not any thing, even the leaſt shalbe fruſtrate, which once he foreshewed by the Prophets, concerning the reſtoring of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the laſt times. Such a one therfore shal Chriſt be, notable by theſe marks, when he shal beginne the converſion of this people. His promiſe shal ſeeme to have bin forgotten through long delay; which at length he shal performe, with moſt plentiful increaſe of new joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And who jugeth and fighteſt iuſtly:</hi> So Theod. Beza tranſlateth, a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive being put between, as though theſe things togither with the former, should conſtitute the <hi>name</hi> it ſelfe: which in the reſt is wonte to be shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but the ſenſe is al one, ſeing it is in likeweiſe, whither a man be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch by his name, or found to be of this ſort in very deed. The worde have this force properly; <hi>and he iudgeth and fighteth in righteouſneſſe:</hi> where the coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> copulative may be a cauſal, as though theſe words should render a reaſon, both of the white horſe, and alſo of the name; &amp; should
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:6819:325"/> be added to the ſame in ſtead of an interpretation. He ſitteth upon a white horſe, becauſe he fighteth righteouſly. His name is <hi>faithful and true,</hi> becau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe he iudgeth righteouſly. Which words are ſpoken in reſpect of his own people, taken, as they ſeem, out of Pſal. 96.10.13. where, to iudge in truth and righteouſnes, ſignifyeth to rule and moderate his people in fra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming and ordering their life according to truth and righteouſnes, &amp; that not onely as touching their outward actions, but alſo in reſpect of inward newneſſe of the heart: which dependeth upon the regeneration of the Spirit, wherby we are reformed after the Image of God, as Calvin hath written very wel. Theſe words therfore declare the effectual power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which Chriſt shal now beſtow abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his; and moreover ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fety from their enemies, with whom he wil make warre and render them a reward meet for their deſerts.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>And his eyes:</hi> The ſecond part of the deſcription: where <hi>his eyes are as it were a flame of fyre, and on his head are many crownes: but a name unknowne to all men, but to himſelfe alone.</hi> As touching his eyes, they are moſt sharpe, pearſing al things, which as flames of fyre conſume whatſoever letteth the ſight, make lightſome the darkeneſſe it ſelfe, and ſet moſt hidden things in the light. What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hide it ſelfe from ſuch eyes? Such an one shal Chriſt shew himſelfe in drawing out his people into the light of truth, from the hidden dennes and darkeneſſe wherſoever they lurked, ſo as this sharpnes of ſight shalbe very admirable to the world. <hi>I wil ſay to the North,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>give, and to the South keepe not backe, bring my ſonnes from farre, and my daughters from the endes of the earth,</hi> Iſay 43.6. <hi>The crownes are many,</hi> becauſe of the many ſingular victories, which the Iewes shal get, when firſt they shal give their name to Chriſt, from thoſe ſundry nations, among which they live diſperſed, ſtriving as much as they can againſt their converſion. But why is his name unknown? that here we may know that great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be, wherat Paul cryed out, <hi>O the deepneſſe of the richeſſe, both of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of God! how unſearcheable are his iudgements, and his waies paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11.33. &amp;c. There he ſpeaketh of this ſame thing, of the hardening of the Iewes for a time, &amp; calling at length in their time: which whole matter he concludeth with an admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods wiſdome, affirming that no wit of any creature can comprehende the infinitneſſe of the myſtery. So this viſion foreshewing in the calling of the Iewes, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine choiſe and ſeparation of an elect people from others, after the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentils shal come in, preſenteth Chriſt likeweiſe in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known name, becauſe no creature can by any reaſon conceive the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greatneſſe of this iudgement and mercy. Let us therfore reverence
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:6819:326"/> this name, which becauſe of the highneſſe thereof, muſt needs be hidden from every creature. Onely let us obſerve the congruency of things, that the converſion of the Iewes doth likeweiſe come from the unſearcheable wiſdome of God, as once the reiection of them and receaving of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liles.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>And he was clothed with a garment dipt in blood:</hi> Such hath bin the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the Captaine <hi>gathering togither</hi> his people: now followeth the shape of him <hi>making warre:</hi> which therfore he taketh upon him, that in fighting iuſtly, he may make his no leſſe ſecure from all outward feare of warre, then he maketh them happy at home by iudging iuſtly and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating al things moſt conveniently. The figure of this is <hi>a bloody garment,</hi> and a name <hi>that word of God.</hi> For after this converſion begun, and a happy increaſe of the name of Chriſtians for ſome yeeres, then a huge and cruell warr shalbe raiſed up, ſuch as the like hath not bin in any time. The Turk shal rage in the Eaſt. The Beaſt and falſe Prophet in the Weſt part: both of them shal endevour to root out even every footſtep of the truth, as Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el sheweth clearly chap. 11.44.45. and 12.1. and Ezechiel chap. 38. &amp; 39. as farre as belongeth to the Turk. And as it is mentioned at the ende of this chapter, concerning the Beaſt and his companion. Then shall Chriſt shew himſelfe to be ſeene in this forme clothed with a bloody caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocke, and wholly ſwimming with blood of the enemies. VVhich time I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah ſeemeth to have reſpect unto, ſaying, <hi>Who is he that commeth from Edo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with read garments, from Bozrah? Wherfore is thy apparell red, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine preſſe,</hi> chap. 63.1.2. For very good reaſon now shal Chriſt be ſeen ſprinkled with the blood of the enemies ſlaine. And then shal the Iewes be ſuch in deed, through their tender minds mel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting into teares, as the Prophet in the chapters following deſcribeth that they ar to be hereafter. The <hi>name</hi> is fit for this time, <hi>that word of God,</hi> which the world then shal finde to be moſt true, al thoſe things at length being performed, which have bin delivered in the ſcriptures. Before time it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt counted the <hi>word of God</hi> as a thing to be mocked at, as it doth alſo in this time, becauſe it ſeeth both the promiſes and punishments to be differteth ſo long. Ye the citizens began to doubt of the truth therof: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence is that complaint in Iſaiah, <hi>the Lord hath forſaken mee, and the Lord hath forgotten mee,</hi> chap. 44.14. As though the promiſes were nothing elſe then great words onely, or vayne lofty ſpeeches which had come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Therfore Chriſt shal declare now in truth, that the leaſt title of it hath not bin in vaine. This deſcription agreeth to the ſeventh vial, under which shalbe heard that ſaying, <hi>it is done,</hi> chap. 16.17. <hi>And the myſtery of
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:6819:326"/> God is finiſhed,</hi> chap. 10.7. to which time is reſerved the perfection of all things, and the greateſt authority of Gods word shal flouriſh, the moſt conſtant truth therof being ſeen in every thing.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>And the hoſts which are in heaven:</hi> The laſt part of the deſcription: where the preparation conſiſteth, partly in the <hi>ſouldiers,</hi> in this verſe; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>in the weapons and inſtruments of warre,</hi> ver, 15. But the name is <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi> ver. 16. The army ſeemeth to be provided, not ſo much for battel, as for triumph. For what are <hi>white horſes to warre?</hi> What <hi>fine white linnen and pure?</hi> A helmet &amp; corſelet were fitter. And ſo the thing is in deed. A triumph is ſet forth, not a battel: for the enemies in the Weſt and Eaſt part being at length deſtroyed in that late foreſaid warre; a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peace shalbe reſtored to the Church, &amp; which no tumultuous noiſe of troubles, shal ever after interrupt. Then al the children of God shall keepe a perpetual triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph, al things being remooved for ever which might procure any trouble, as shalbe made more cleare, from the things folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Which are in heaven:</hi> The cityzens of the holy Church on earth: all of them making one ſheepfold, shall folow one shepheard Chriſt: <hi>they ar clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with white and pure fine linnen,</hi> for the ſame cauſe which we have ſpoken of at the 8. verſe.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>And out of his mouth went;</hi> The victory once gotten, shalbe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ever: neither shal ther be any feare of warre to beginne againe, our Captaine being ſo furnished, that as he can, ſo he wil much more reſtraine the ſubdued enemies at his pleaſure: for <hi>the sword comming out of his mouth,</hi> shal punish them forthwith, as before he threatned to them of Pergamus, <hi>that he would fight againſt them with the Spirit of his mouth,</hi> chap. 2.16. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignifyed, that either the enemies shalbe deſtroyed according to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſacred word, the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts being taken of them, which the <hi>word</hi> hath appointed againſt them: or at the leaſt shalbe brought to that caſe, that wil they, nil they, they shal obey thoſe lawes, which the <hi>word</hi> ſhal preſcribe. This latter ſeemeth to agree better to this place, when al nations shalbe obedient to the Church, ſeeking and receiving from it lawes and ordinances, wherby they may be governed. Theſe therfore ſhal be ſmitten after this manner. But if any yet being ſtubburne, shal refuſe to obey, <hi>he ſhalbe ſubdued with a rod of iron;</hi> and shalbe bridled by a rigou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous government; but if he shal continue in his obſtinacy, neither wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfs to be overcome and bowed by an ordinary way, although ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny togither shal conſpire to the ſame wickedneſſe of rebellion, they shall be caſt <hi>as cluſters of grapes into the winepreſſe of the fierceneſſe of God, and ſhall he

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pl. &amp; the K, B, read <hi>a ſharp two edged ſword doth tread,</hi> in the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, becauſe puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe no mor differred as before, but the wicked shalbe puni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhed, preſently to be trode under foote with great fury, as grapes in the wine preſſe, Iſaiah 63. Lam. 1.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ The wine preſſe of the fierceneſſe:</hi> VVhich punishment of the wicked ſhal be no leſſe pleaſant to God, then the drinking of wine to the thirſtie. That muſt need, be done manfully, in which one is occupied with delight. Hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rible therfore shalbe the punishment of the wicked, which by the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſnes therof shal make amends aboundantly, for the delights of al the former times: See Deut. 28.63.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>And he hath upon his garment and upon his thigh:</hi> This name is written on his garment, becauſe it ſhalbe manifeſt then to al men, that Chriſt is the ſupreme King: which was not ſo evident to the world in former ages. The Chriſtian name hath bin ſpread before now into al contries; but how miſerably did the Heathen Romane Emperours vexe that firſt, when it be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan? Since that time, by how ſundry entrepriſes hath the Pope of Rome endevoured to bring deſtruction unto it? Neither yet at this time doth he ſurceaſe from his former practiſe; having now the Turk alſo a partner in the ſame trafick; although both follow a divers way of obtaining their deſire. Doubtleſſe ſince that Chriſt hath bin made known to us Gentiles, he hath not ſeemed ſo much to raigne, a to ſerve a miſerable ſervice. Yet nevertheleſſe he gave alwayes ſome proof of his Kingdome, even in the middes of theſe miſeries, becauſe he preſerved his Church againſt al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s willes, howſoever he yeelded her to the luſt of the enemies; and to be over whelmed almoſt with all calamities and miſeries. But now at length the contrary shalbe manifeſt to al men: Chriſt himſelfe wil take the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his hands, &amp; wil give the ſoveraigntie over the things on earth to his Church; then shalbe the time, when <hi>the ſtone being cut of the mountain without hands, ſhal breake in peeces the yron, the clay, the ſilver and the gold: and ſhal obtaine a Kingdome that ſhal never be deſtroyed, neither shal be left to another people,</hi> Dan. 2.44.45. VVhich thing is made more apparant from the name written on the thigh, as it were in the loweſt parts of the body, and even as though it were in the foote. For the ſcriptures are wonte to call all beneath the belly, <hi>the feete,</hi> Gen. 49.10. Iſay. 7.20. Therfore he hath this name written in this part, not onely becauſe that which is loweſt in Chriſt, ſcarce reaching to his feete, is higher then the higheſt thing in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Monarches bearing the titles of Empire on their head, on their crownes,
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:6819:327"/> and Diademes; but Chriſt carying a loftier title on his thigh, then any Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narch ever hath obtained; not, I ſay, for this cauſe onely, but chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this shalbe the time, wherin his feete, that is, <hi>his Church, shal beare rule.</hi> Before time they were fine Braſſe burning in a fornace, yet free from any hurt, chap. 1.15. But now after the fierie trial, they shal enioy a moſt noble Kingdome. <hi>Now</hi> Chriſt <hi>shal honour the place of his feet,</hi> Iſay 60.13. This is that Kingdome, which al the Prophets doo praiſe with ſo great decking of words; of which ther shalbe no ende; but after that it hath flou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhed a long time on earth, it shalbe tranſlated from hence at length into heaven at the ſecond comming of Chriſt. So then theſe <hi>foure names</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine the whole ſtate of the Church from the calling of the Iswes unto the laſt ende of al things. Al which time may be diſtinguished into three parts, <hi>the firſt</hi> of which goeth before the battel with the Beaſt and the Dragon: wherunto the <hi>firſt two names</hi> with the whole preparation, are applyed. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is beſtowed in the battel it ſelfe, ſignifyed by a third name. The <hi>third</hi> is al the other ſpace from the victory until Chriſt shal come, to which the fourth moſt mighty name agreeth.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>Then I ſaw a certain Angel ſtand in the Sunne:</hi> Thus farre the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Captaine:</hi> now of certain <hi>ſoldiers,</hi> who muſt fight with the Beaſt. Theſe ar muſtered by the voice of an <hi>Herald</hi> of armes <hi>ſtanding in the Sunne:</hi> who differreth from him that <hi>powred out his vial upon the Sunne:</hi> for this, by interpreting the Scriptures, shal bring a plague; that other shal provoke the Saincts to warre by exhorting. Neither perhaps doth he that powreth out the <hi>vial,</hi> ſtande in the very <hi>Sunne,</hi> but ſet in an other place, shal ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle his liquour upon it. This, ſitting as it were in the charet of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> hath his ſtanding in the very light. But how, wilt thou ſay, can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave any ſuch thing yea by meditating upon it? I think light may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this Sunne, from the 12. chap. 1. where we heard that the woman was <hi>clothed with the Sunne,</hi> that is, shining round about with a moſt cleare light of the Scriptures, with the clearneſſe wherof being adorned, as it were with a garment, shee came forth abroad among the people, &amp; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelfe in the ſight of the world. But one may be ſaid <hi>to ſtand</hi> in his clothing, <hi>as the wife ſtanding at the right hand of the King in gold of Ophir,</hi> Pſal. 45.10. Vherfore this Angel shalbe ſome cityze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that particular Church, which shal shine moſt clearly by the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the very ſacred truth, &amp; shalbe a natural daughter <hi>of the woman clothed with the Sunne.</hi> VVe know that there is not the ſame purity of al particular Churches which profeſſe Chriſt, but that one doth take out more dreggs than an other. But this Angel shalbe a member of a moſt pure and chaſt congregation, which
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:6819:328"/> above others shal shine with this glorious apparell. This is not one of the converted Iewes, of whom he began to ſpeake even now, but an Angel of the VVeſt part, calling the VVeſterne men to warre againſt the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, the plagues of our world. And indeed, al the force of this laſt warre in the VVeſt, ſeemeth to be converted againſt that holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which things in ſome ſort may be underſtood, what is that place <hi>Armagedon</hi> in the VVeſt part, wherof we heard in chap. 16.16.

And it is like that after Rome is overthrown that the Pope will againe place his chaire at Avenion (but I have no certenty concerning this thing, I follow onely coniecture,) but if he shal ſit there, where shall he ſooner and more gladly ſtreine to doo his uttermoſt, than againſt the Genevean people of Savoy hardby; a heart ſore, thankes be to God, now for ſome yeeres, which shal then alſo be the totment of their eyes? And verily, farre be it that my words should grieve any man, the <hi>Sunne</hi> of our world shineth there and from thence; &amp; that alwayes it may shine more, every godly man deſireth earneſtly of God; neither let my repeated admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nition be ſuperfluous. <hi>Hold that thou haſt, let no man take thy crowne.</hi> In the meane time our prayers shal not be wanting for thee, that the Sunne of righteouſneſſe may ever shine upon thee, and drive farre away all darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <hi>¶ Saying to all the foules that did fly by the middes of heaven:</hi> It hath bin ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in chap. 8.13. &amp; 14.6. that <hi>meſouranema</hi> ſignifyeth between heaven and earth, not <hi>meſembrian</hi> midde day, which the Aſtronomers call the mids of heaven, and that therfore the word belongeth to them, who have eſcaped from groſſe ſuperſtition through the acknowledging of the truth, and yet have not attained that purity, meet for the inhabitants of heaven. The <hi>Angel of the Sunne</hi> calleth all theſe to take part of the ſpoile, as being nouriſſons of the ſame truth, howſoever it flourisheth not among all with the like purity. From which wee underſtand, that although one or ſome few congregations shal practize ſincere godlines when this warre shalbe moved, yet that very many, and thoſe even of the reformed religion shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be found, which eyther never have attained a ful reformation, or by negli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence and careleſneſſe have fallen backe to that ſtate, that they lack much of the holineſſe of a pure and undefiled ſpouſe. And who ſeeth not, that
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:6819:328"/> mutation to come to paſſe every day more and more? Obſtinate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will not acknowledge this difference at this time, but they to whom it is gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to meaſure every thing by the onely rule of the truth, doo both ſee &amp; bewaile both many ſhamefully falling from heaven, and alſo others as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teores, hanging yet in the clouds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Come and gather your ſelves togither:</hi> He calleth them to a banker, &amp; to mirth. The moſt worthy deſtruction of the wicked men, is to God as a ſumptuous feaſt.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>That ye may eate the fleſh of things:</hi> It is like that the ten hornes which have hated and burnt the whore Rome, shal alſo hate the very Beaſt, once the ſweet heart of the whore. Therfore theſe Kings, who shal ioyne their armies with the Beaſt, are not in the number of thoſe tenne. Neither ſhal ther be onely a denary number of Kings in the times of Antichriſt, when as beſide them others shalbe founde, who doo lend him their helpe. VVhich manner of dreames, how vaine they are, may be underſtood fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe things which wee have ſpoken before. Theſe things then being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, now the Angel being ſure of the victory, calleth to the pray, and biddeth them to flye togither, that they may be filled with the ſpoiles of the enemies. And becauſe variety in feaſts doth very much delight men, he propoſeth ſundry kinds of dainty diſhes, <hi>the fleſh of Kings, of High Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines &amp;c.</hi> This ſupper shalbe variable and very coſtly.

But he shal not remaine alive long time after, not abov five and fourty yeeres at the moſt, as may be gathered by a diligent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of other Scriptures. Neither indeed being ſpoiled of his principal Chaire, shal he be deſtitute of al aide of Kings, but ſome, to weet, of the earth, followers of wicked ſuperſtition shal yet take his part; who al their hoſts being gathered and ioyned togither againſt Chriſt and his Saincts, shall beginne this battel to try their laſt chance.

The Beaſt</hi> is taken, intraped as it were, with ſnares upon a ſudden; as wild Beaſts, which unawares fall into the netts. For ſo the word <hi>epiaſte</hi> ſeemeth to note. And we know <hi>that the Lord doth raine downe upon the wicked ſnares,</hi> as in Pſal. 11.6. by which their feet are taken there, where leaſt of al they feared. <hi>The falſe Prophet</hi> is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togither with him: which two ioyned togither, shew that the Pope of Rome (for he shal retaine this name perhaps, after the city is deſtroyed,) shal at length utterly periſh, both in reſpect of the civil powr wherby he is <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and alſo of the ſpiritual, wherby he is <hi>the Falſe Prophet.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſpeaketh as of two diſtinct perſons, becauſe of that twofold wickednes wherby <hi>that man of ſinne</hi> is famous: but when I ſay the Pope of Rome, I doe not onely meane that particular man, who then shal ſit in the Chaire, but alſo the very ſtate and order of Popes, which now wholly shal come to naught; in ſuch ſort that no remainders therof shalbe left. Onely a certen hated memory shal continue, that his impiety hath bin the cauſe of the <hi>ruine of ſo many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Who wrought miracles;</hi> Before there was mention <hi>of the falſe Prophet</hi> in chap. 16.13. But becauſe a bare name was there onely; that it might be unknown to no man, whom he ſpeaketh of by this name, he deſcribeth the ſame here by certain tokens, that all doubt may be taken away. <hi>Who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wrought miracles, wherby he deceaved them, which receive the Beaſts marke, and worſhipped his Image.</hi> By which things he sheweth moſt plainly, that this <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi> is that ſecond Beaſt, of which in chap. 13.13. &amp;c. Therfore, let the Papiſts now ſee to it, who wil have Antichriſt to raigne three yeeres and an halfe, before Chriſt shal come to the laſt iudgement; and he to be a ſingular perſon; whither or no, they doo not proclaime o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen warre againſt the truth? All grant, that eyther this ſecond Beaſt, or that firſt, is Antichriſt. Both which flourished long before, that the digni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty and maieſty of Rome the whore, began to be diminiſhed. And alſo both shal remaine for ſome few yeeres, after the overthrow therof, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth manifeſtly from this place. Should we limit al this time, eyther with the ſpace of three yeeres, or with the boundes of one mortal man? But concerning the time of Antichriſt, the things that have bin ſpoken at chap. 17. are ſo certain and evident, that no man can now be in doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they were both caſt alive:</hi> As Coral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="643" facs="tcp:6819:329"/> Popedome shalbe horrible. The Spirit putteth a manifeſt difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his puniſhment, and the reſt of the multitude, which shal warre for him. It were better for him to perish by fyre, as the whore perished, but a more greevous example shalbe shewed in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Into a lake offyre:</hi> Into the ſecond death, to weet, everlaſting, in chap. 21.8. But how can the Papacy be caſt into the fire? That which is proper to men, is tranſlated unto the ſtate and condition of men, shewing as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſaid, that not onely men shalbe punished with ſome greevous pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishment, but alſo that the thing it ſelfe shalbe utterly taken away, never for to raiſe againe: even as they, who are caſt to hell, muſt not expect any returning or ſetting free. Certenly we may gather, and that not rashly, from this ſtrange and unacuſtomed taking of vengeance, that God will shew by ſome viſible ſigne, how damnable and deteſtable he hath alwayes eſteemed the Papacy. And this laſt is that deſtruction, of which in chap. 17.18. <hi>ſhal goe into deſtruction:</hi> a iuſt reward of the Antichriſtian tyranny.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>And the reſt were ſlaine with the ſword:</hi> Such then is the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prince of wickedneſſe: now of his armies and ſouldiers. Of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther is a differing puniſhment, not ſo horrible, at leaſt in shew: <hi>they ſhalbe ſlaine with the ſword of him that ſiteth on the horſe:</hi> that is, by the word comming out of his mouth, as though he should ſay, they shal undergoe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments threatned in the word againſt the diſobedient, and ſuch as reſiſt the truth; as in Ieremy: <hi>Behold I wil make my words as fire in thy mouth, and this people as wood, and it ſhal devoure them,</hi> chap. 5.14. What ſingular thing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pope have? For he alſo hath bin ſlaine with this ſword. That is true indeed; but the word threatneth divers punishments, according to the manner of the wickedneſſes: the moſt greevous, to the greateſt; the lighter, to the leſſe. Peradventure becauſe the ruine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy shalbe more horrible than wee think, it is exempted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon order: not becauſe it is not denounced in the word, but perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is leſſe regarded of us, and that we ſuſpect it to be lighter then the event will shew. Or, as we have declared in ver. 15. it may be that theſe ſouldiers, after the overthrow received, shall yeeld their vanquished for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the truth, and ſubiect their neckes to her yoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And all the foules were filled with their fleſh:</hi> The Victory being obtained the foules gather to the pray, &amp; doo fill themſelves with the ſpoiles. That whole late Popish natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal be ſubiect afterward to the reformed Churh. Every country being a nourriſſon of the purer truth, shal have ſome part of the regions, before time given up to ſuperſtition, made ſubiect to them. Which thing ſeemeth to be ſignifyed by the foules ſatiated with the flesh
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:6819:330"/> of the ſlaine army. Such then is the end of the Romish Pope and Papacy, that remained a few yeeres after the city: yet at length ſo much the more miſerable, becauſe shee had ſuch as did adorne her funerall with their teares, and performed the laſt duties by weeping. But ther shal be none left for the Pope, to bewaile his miſery; but he shal die infamous, without mourners, or other funeral pompe. Wherby at laſt is accomplished that prophetical parable of the gheſts called to the marriage, Mat. 22. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoſe good and evill ſent for out of the high wayes, are the Gentiles, that embraced the calling, after that the Iewes had refuſed it. Among them, the man that had not a wedding garment, is the Church of Rome, which deſpiſeth the righteouſneſſe of faith, neither regardeth to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the merit of Chriſt by imputation. The King comming in, and beholding her clothed with her ragges, but not with that garment which onely he approoveth, now at length biddeth his ſervants to bind her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and foote, and to caſt her into utter darkeneſſe, where is weeping &amp; gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of teeth. For Chriſt ſpeaketh not there of any one man, but colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively of a very great multitude, as the ſentence added in the end decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that many are called but few are choſen,</hi> ver. 14. From which at length we underſtand, that the bright comming of the Lord, with which Paul foreshewed that the man of ſinne should be abolished; 2 Theſ. 2.8. is not his laſt coming to iudgement, but that wherby Chriſt shal take the Iewes into the fellowship of his holy Church: at which time his Kingdome shal flourish moſt gloriouſly, and shal exceed by infinite degrees all the bright<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of the ages paſt, as shal be made more evident from the things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. After the Pope is deſtroyed, the Dragon shalbe abolished, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny other things accomplished on earth.</p>

The repetition is framed according to three ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: the firſt, in which the Divell was taken, in the firſt verſe. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:6819:331"/> how long he was bound, in the ſecond verſe; the third, when and how lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g he should be looſed, in the end of the third verſe. And all theſe thinges briefly; which after are repeated more largely, by mentioning therewithall the ſtate of the Church, of what ſorte it was in the meane time, through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe periods. In the firſt, wherin the Dragon was taken, the ſaints were beheaded, at the beginning of the fourth verſe. In the ſecond, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Divill or Dragon was bound, there was an unlike conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men: for the ſaincts raigned a thouſand yeeres (which was the time of the priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divill,) both in reſpect of the ſoules ſlaine in the former peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, and alſo in reſpect of them that were on earth, who ſtrove with the Beaſt, neither did ſubmit under his yoke by any meanes, in the ſame verſe, The other lived not againe all that time, but being deceived by the frauds and impoſtures of the Beaſt, lay as it were dead and buried in their errors, in the fift verſe. The third period, which is of the Divill being looſed, rela<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth both the condition of the elect, and alſo the furie of the Dragon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging againe. Thoſe thouſande yeeres being expired, the elect lived, not a few, as in the ſecond period, but they roſe againe in a farre greater multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the errours of the Beaſt being left, and themſelves converted unto true godlines. Which reſurrection is called the firſt and bleſſed, becauſe of the Prieſtly and Kingly dignity, &amp; long continuing of the raigne with Chriſt, in the ſixt verſe. The furie of the Dragon after a thouſand yeeres priſonment, shalbe revived, in the ſeventh verſe. He shall muſter ſouldiers known by name, Gog and Magog, infinite in multitude, in the eight ver. He shall ſpoile all farr and neare, and shal beſiege the tents of the ſaincts, in the beginning of the ninth verſe, and ſo farr proceedeth the repetition of the former ages. That which dooth follow from thence, is to come, his attempt againſt the beloved City, and utter overthrow both of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in the ende of the ninth verſe, and alſo of himſelfe, in the tenth verſe. And thus farre is the deſtruction of the enemies; afterward the happines of the Saints is handled, wherby the Church shall shine having eſcaped all theſe calamities. Which felicity is declared two wayes, both by the gathe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring togither of the ſaincts, in the reſt of this chapter, and condition of them being gathered, in thoſe that followe. The gathering hath a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and execution. The preparation is of the Iudge fitting upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great throne in the eleventh verſe.

Who this Angel is we have learned from the former things, to weet, that it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the Great, who being borne the manchilde of the Church, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king warre for his mothers ſake againſt the Tyrants, the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, the Dragon it ſelfe. He is ſaid to come downe from heaven, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging unexpected aide, in chap. 12.6.7. &amp;c. So the Angel being to fight againſt the whore, and to aſſaile her unwares, was ſaid to come down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven, in the eighteenth chapter and firſt verſe. He hath the keye of the bottomleſſe pit, power to open the ſame, and ſhut up the Dragon, but not to caſt forth the helliſh ſmoke: in which reſpect onely the key was give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, chap. 9.1. There is therfore a great dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference between theſe two keyes. The great chaine, are the foundations of the Chriſtian liberty layd by him, by which he held the Dragon bound as with chaines by a long ſucceſsion of time, that he could not move him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to make any trouble. For now the way was ſtopped up againſt thoſe Heathen, to the chiefe ſoveraignty; or if they attained to it by fraud, as Iuli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an, yet they were ſo bound &amp; tyed with this chaine, that they could not exerciſe their former cruelty.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Who took the Dragon;</hi> Overcame him by open warr, chap. 6.15. &amp; 12.7 For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were overcome, the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, neither could he entrepriſe any ſuch thing as he exerciſed before.
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:6819:332"/> The Heathen Emperours are noted by the names of the very Divell, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in chap. 12.9. the articles being alſo added for the preheminence of the wickedneſſe, becauſe they may by right be eſteemed by his name, of whoſe poyſon, malitiouſnes, and wickednes, they have bin the miniſters. Worthily doth a man beare his name, whoſe manners and diſpoſition he taketh upon him. This <hi>apprehenſion</hi> ſignifyeth that whole firſt period, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the time of Iohn and before, even unto Conſtantine, the laſt part of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put for the whole. For ſaying that now the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he would have it to be underſtood that before, he ran to and fro, deviſing as much evill as he could, as we learned in the ſeales, at chap. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And hound him for a thouſand yeeres:</hi> He ordained that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of ruling, which being afterward extended to a thouſand yeeres, left no power to the open enemies to raigne over the Church, as in former time. And this is the ſecond period, in which the Dragon was bound, that is, the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperours were repreſſed unto the yeere 130. But I ſay this period to be of the Dragon, becauſe it is not that full period, which before the Spirit did ſet of the whole Prophecy, to weet, of the trumpets. For this is of a longer time, and exceedeth that of the Dragon about two hundred thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeeres and more. The hiſtory of the Dragon hath ſome thing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it ſelfe, neither is it ſtrictly to be aſtrained to that rule. The binding of him is more ancient, then the blowing of the trumpets, done under the ſixt ſeale, about the yeere 306, as was ſaid in chap. 6.12. and 12.7.8 9. But the trumpets gave their firſt ſound in the Nicene Councill, chap. 8.7. and in their ſixt ſound, brought to the Dragon a releaſing from priſon, chap. 9.15. Wherfore wee now underſtand that this ſecond period is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Dragon; agreeing with the trumpets, neither in beginning nor ende. The Ieſuit Ribera meaſureth the times for the moſt part by the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per ſignification of the words, as the five moneths of the locuſts; three yeeres and an halfe of the raigne of Antichriſt: yet nevertheleſſe he would have theſe thouſand yeeres to be taken indefinitely, for the whole ſpace, from the death of Chriſt, even unto the time of Antichriſt, to which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, at leaſt as touching the beginning of the account, very many both of the old and new writers doo condeſcende. But why have they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Beaſt, which is the very Antichriſt, raigned this whole thouſand yeeres, in which the Dragon was bounde. Therfore his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnement was not to be ended at the beginning of the raigne of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but this rather was to beginn togither with it. That I may not now ſpeak any thing of that barre, which the Spirit hath put at chap. 4.1. <hi>I will ſhew thee thoſe things which muſt be done hereafter:</hi> which forbiddeth to
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:6819:332"/> looke back to the time paſt, and warneth that all the folowing prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, conſiſteth in things to come, and latter then the age of Iohn. Further more the agreement of the whole Prophecy which wee have ſeene hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not beare ſuch a biginning to be made, as troubleth all things with confuſion, which we cannot rid ourſelves of. But shal we thing that the Divell was bound, when he raged moſt cruelly by the firſt Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours? When may we ſay that he was looſed, if then he lay in priſon, and in the ſtockes? That which the Ieſuite alleageth out of the 12. chap. of Iohn, <hi>Now the Prince of this world ſhalbe caſt forth,</hi> belongeth nothing to this cauſe, for ſo much as this is to be underſtood of the ſpiritual power, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forthwith to be utterly deſtroyed by the death of Chriſt: but the bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which the Revelation ſpeaketh of, belongeth to his tyranny over the bodies of the Saints, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the fourth verſe of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is manifeſt, where the ſoules of the Saints raigning after the Drago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was caſt into bondes, pertaine to them, who were beheaded by the ſame before his bondes, raging moſt furiouſly. Which calamity, what other can it be, than that of the cruelty of the Heathen Emperours? Wherfore neither the beginning nor ende of theſe thouſand yeers is ſet downe right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly by the Ieſuite.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And he caſt him into the bottomleſſe pit.</hi> This bottomleſſe pit is the earth, as it is manifeſt from chap. 12.3. where it is ſaid, <hi>when the dragon ſaw that he was caſt unto the earth,</hi> which yet is not ſo called after the cuſtome of the common ſpeach, but to note out earthly men; who in name onely ar cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted citizens of the Church. The woe alſo is denounced <hi>to the inhabitans of the earth and ſea, becauſe the Divell is come down to them,</hi> as in the ſame place verſe 12. Now he muſt be converſant among theſe onely, &amp; his fury muſt be exerciſed againſt theſe, as hath bin declared in the ſaid place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And ſhut him up and ſealed upon him:</hi> To weet, the doore, or ſtone, or ſome ſuch thing, <hi>as they made the ſepulchre ſure, ſealing the ſtone,</hi> Mat. 27.66. by which is ſignifyed, that the Devill was committed to moſt ſure cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſuch as he should not have ſo much leave as to look out of doores. Not becauſe he should be vacant from buſines altogither by the ſpace of the whole thouſand yeeres, (for he should cauſe huge ſturres both by la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and ſea, as we learned even now from chap. 12.12. &amp; know to hav come to paſſe in very truth, by thoſe things which are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned in chap. 8.12.) but becauſe he should have no power at al over the holy Church, againſt which he should undertake al his attempts in vaine. He caſt out a flood af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the woman, but he loſt his labour. For both the earth holpe her, and shee fled into the wilderneſſe, beyond the chaine wherwith the Dragon
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:6819:333"/> was bound, as in chap. 12.15. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ That he ſhould deceive the Gentiles no more:</hi> The Gentiles are alſo the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the falſe Church, whoſe dwelling was in the exteriour court, and in the holy city, two and fourty moneths, chap. 11.2. He ſpeaketh not of theſe Gentiles now, but of them that wer wholly repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the name of Chriſt; ſuch as were thoſe fierce tyrants of Rome, before Conſtantine. This ſorte of enemies should entrepriſe nothing againſt the holy Church, by the ſpace of thoſe yeeres, becauſe they should not know wher it ſhould be; yet in the meane time ſome other cruell enemies should intreate the falſe Church moſt cruelly, chap. 12.17. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ For afterward he muſt be looſed for a little ſeaſon:</hi> After thoſe thouſand yeeres are finished, the Divell was to be looſed againe; wherin is ſet the third time, falling upon the beginning <hi>of the ſixt trumpet:</hi> when the moſt cruel Turke, all feare of the Romane Empire being laid aſyde, which he ſaw to be forſaken of the Weſterne armes, and at home drowned with ſlouthfulnes, riot, and diſſentions, began an horrible tyranny alſo againſt the Church, and not onely the falſe, but alſo the true, which then after a long diſtance of time, began to shew it ſelfe, at leaſt beholding a farre off from the wildernes, whither shee had fled, although ſhee differeth her full returne until ſome ages after. The Divill being then looſed, graunted not ſo much as one houre of reſt from warre; but as ſoon as the truth began to come forth abroad, about the yeere 130, ſtraiteway he provoked the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to vexe the ſame by what meanes he could. Therfore the Turke fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the dominions of the Empire, he paſſeth over into Europe, he increaſeth his victories, he rooteth out the maieſtie of the Romane name: he carieth away all things with him as a ſwift running ſtreame: neither is ther at this day almoſt found any hold ſo ſtrong, that can withſtand his furie. But the time of this tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny is but short, to weet, onely for an houre, a day, a moneth, a yeere, that is, about three hundred ninety yeeres, if wee count the yeere by twelve moneths, and every moneth by thirty daies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the account of two and fourty moneths, and three dayes and an halfe, chap. 11. If we follow the reckening of the Iulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeeres, the impious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shal not be prolonged beyond ſeven yeres more; then utterly to be abolished, without leaving ſo much as the footſteps of his name after him, as shal be ſaid afterward.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Then I ſaw thrones;</hi> Hitherto the brief Hiſtory of the Dragon: the ſame now is handled ſomewhat more fully, there being added togither alſo the ſtate of the Church, wherin it was in every of thoſe times. The two firſt of which are shewed elegantly in the ſame words. For when after the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:6819:333"/> is bound, <hi>the thrones ſet are ſeen, and alſo the ſoules of them that were behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſitting upon them, and iudgement given to them:</hi> by theſe is ſignifyed that the primitive Church was miſerably afflicted, before that mortal enemie was caſt into priſon. Then was ther no ſeat eſtabliſhed for her, no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given, but she lay on the ground trode under foote, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpending the life of many of her members for the truth; whereunto belongeth <hi>the cry of the ſoules,</hi> which deſired vengeance of their moſt cruell enemies, chap. 6.10.11. Therfore all that time from Iohn even until the binding of the Devill by Conſtantine, was a time for the hatched, for fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fires, for the racke, and all manner of torments, as is very wel ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed here. Againe the <hi>ſame thrones, and iudgement given after that the Dragon was delivered to priſon</hi> by Conſtantin, doo shew the notable felicity of the ſecond diſtance of time which the Church enioyed having obtained Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours for her Defendours. For theſe thrones belong not to the ſaincts raigning in heaven, as the Ieſuite will have it, intangling himſelfe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abſurdities; but they which dwell on earth, in a better eſtate, in regard of the open enemy, then in former time. For why should the raigne in heaven be limited with a thouſand yeeres? Or why should they beginne to raigne after the Dragon was bound, as if the raigne in heaven wer not perpetual? Moreover ſuch ar counted in this raigne, who ar dead a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres agoe, as in the next verſe: which can not be underſtood of the raign in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in which, unleſſe the ſoules of them that die, fly forthwith, they shal never afterward come thither. But more plainly of this matter at the next verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they ſate,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it may be put, and perhaps better tranſitve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>they did ſet.</hi> So the order of conſtruction runneth eaſily, being reduced by the accuſative caſes which folow, <hi>et animas,</hi> and the ſoules, <hi>et illos &amp;c.</hi> and them which worshiped not; in the ſame ſenſe <hi>vidi thronos,</hi> I ſaw thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>and they did ſet on them, to whom iudgement alſo was given; both the ſoules of them which were beheaded, and alſo thoſe which worſhipped not the Beaſt &amp;c. who all lived and raigned with Chriſt a thouſand yeeres: and iudgement was given them:</hi> they were dealt with according to their righteouſnes, themſelves being ſet at liberty, and their enemies ſuffering the puniſhments of their cruelty. Even as on the other ſide ons iudgement is ſaid to be taken away, when a man is oppreſſed with iniuries, and the doers of them, goe away ſcotfree as Iob complaineth, <hi>God liveth who hath deſpiſed my iudgement</hi> &amp;c. chap. 27 2, and 34.5. Or <hi>iudgement to be given,</hi> may belong to the raign, as in the Pſalmiſt, <hi>O God give thy iudgements to the King, &amp; thy righteouſnes to the Kings ſonne: Let him iudge thy people iuſtly, and thy poore with equity,</hi> Pſal. 72.1.2. as
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:6819:334"/> though he ſhould ſay, the Church now is advanced to that dignity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by shee should give lawes to others, which but lately was accuſtomed to receive them, being moſt abiect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and obſcure, and of no eſtimation with the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the ſoules of them that were beheaded.</hi> If <hi>ekathiſon they ſate,</hi> be taken as a verbe neuter, then theſe words are to be referred to the verbe <hi>eidon, &amp; vidi animas, and I ſaw the ſoules</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the ſoules of the godly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of the firſt period, who under the Heathen Emperours, laid downe their lives for Chriſts ſake; who now at length by meanes of Conſtantine, obtaine glory and honour. But how is this, wilt thou ſay, they not being on the earth? Their ſoules were placed on thrones, when they who tooke away their lives uniuſtly, were iuſtly punished by Conſtantine, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tyrants were killed, and condigne puniſhment inflicted upon them for their cruelty. <hi>The iuſt man ſhall reioice when he ſeeth the vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the wicked, and ſhal waſh his footſteppes in their blood,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt deſcribeth. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>a two edged ſword is in the hand of the Saincts, to execute vengeance on the Heathen, which honour ſhalbe to all the Saincts,</hi> Pſal. 149. It is a glorious thing for the Saincts, that their iniuries are nor neglected, but ar at length reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with iuſt puniſhment. This is it which the ſoules deſired earneſtly, chap. 6.10. And theſe ſeats are that deliverance which they obtained a promiſe off in the ſame place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And which worſhipped not the Beaſt;</hi> Theſe alſo were placed, or ſate in the ſeates; which are <hi>men</hi> then living in the ſecond period; wherupon he not onely mentioneth their ſoules, as even now of the Martyrs, which were in the age paſt, but the whole man, ſaying <hi>thoſe which worſhipped not &amp;c.</hi> From which we muſt obſerve, ſeing the godly are deſcribed by thoſe marks, <hi>that they worſhipped not the Beaſt, neither ſuffered themſelves to be noted with his marke either in the forehead or on the hand,</hi> and that in the ſecond peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Devill was bound, which took the beginning at Conſtantine himſelfe, and continued from thence by the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres, that the Beaſt was all this time. Otherweiſe ther could have bin no praiſe of the Godly living in this time, if there had bin no occaſion and matter for them to get praiſe by. Wherfore the Beaſt was bred togither with Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, when the Dragon being thruſt out of heaven and going into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>gave his power and his throne and great authority to the Beaſt,</hi> chap. 12.13. and 13.2. He could not ſuffer that any truce should be granted to the Church, but when he ſaw his open furie to be repreſſed, he ordained the Beaſt his Vicar in his roome, being abſent, by whoſe endevour at leaſt, he might ſatiſfy his hatred. Therfore the three yeeres raigne of Antichriſt is
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:6819:334"/> a trifling toy, a part wherof we ſee here manifeſtly to extende unto a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres. Secondly, let the Papiſts conſider, what a vaine forgerie that Antichriſt is, whom they dreame off. For there is no Antichriſt properly ſo called, and for excellency, whom the Spirit in this Revelation teacheth to us, beſides that <hi>Beaſt</hi> of the thirteenth chapter. But the Papiſts Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is not this Beaſt, as not being to come, before theſe thouſand yeer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the binding of the Divill be finished. So the Ieſuite teacheth that theſe thouſand yeeres are without doubt the whole time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the death of Chriſt even to the time of Antichriſt. But this Beaſt ruleth through all the time in which the Devill lay bound. Therfore the are meere toyes, which the Ieſuite obtrude to the world, miſerably deceaving, as others, ſo much more themſeves: who are altogither careleſſe of a preſent deſtruction, and quake at ſome vaine ſhadowes to come. They reſt, I know, in this matter upon the authority of ſome Holy Fathers, to whom they doo no leſſe iniury, then procure danger to themſelves. Theſe being farr from the event of things, ſpake onely by coniecture, which to preferre before moſt certain events, is not onely fooliſh, but alſo greatly contrary to the minds of them, who every where confeſsing their ignorance, provoked rather to ſearch out the truth which the day should teach, then to reſt in their doubts, which even they themſelves condemned of ignorance. Wherfore they who will yet holde faſt their known errours, are deprived by the iuſt iudgement of God of all even common ſenſe: that ſo in flattering &amp; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling themſelves gently, they may throw themſelves headlong to eternal and unevitable deſtruction. Furthermore obſerve from this place, that the two and fourty moneths in chap. 11.2. and 13.5. are not to be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred after the common manner, ſeeing the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> to whom theſe moneths belong, was in the view and eyes of men, the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres, as it is manifeſt from his adverſaries, who should be altogither none, if he should not be at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they lived and raigned</hi> Both the ſoules of the Martyrs, and thoſe which withſtood the Beaſt, enioyed a Kingdome with Chriſt this whole time, in which the Dragon was bound. Not that any one continued his life ſo long, but becauſe ther never wanted a ſucceſsion of the godly, who embraced the truth, notwithſtanding the rage of Antichriſt. To acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth, is in very deed <hi>to live and raign with Chriſt,</hi> even as on the contrary, eyther not to know, or to deſpiſe the ſame, is in living, to be dead, and in the higheſt top of raigne, to be in a more vile eſtate, then the moſt abiect ſlave. But he maketh mention of the raigne of theſe yeeres, not becauſe when they were finished the Saints should ceaſe to raign, (for
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:6819:335"/> wee ſee that <hi>the firſt reſurrection</hi> doth follow by and by, which should make the former glory more aboundant,) but becauſe the Church in theſe yeers chiefly, lying hid in the wildernes, and in the ſecret of the temple, should ſeeme to the world to have perished utterly, chap. 11.1. and 12.14. he sheweth that the ſame <hi>raigned with Chriſt</hi> all this moſt ſorowfull time. Which doubt could not befall concerning the ſaints in heaven, who wee know, doo enioy a bleſſed time, as ſoone as they are departed out of this valley of teares. This raign of moſt couragious champions, was shewed before by that holy army of an hundred fourty foure thouſand, who cam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped in Mount Sion, and followed the Lambe, whither ſoever he went, ch. 14.1.2. wherof this verſe is a rehearſall.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>But the reſt of the dead.</hi> Such then was the ſtate of the Saincts by the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres of the Dragons binding. Now in a few words is ſignifyed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of the multitude in that ſpace. Theſe refuſed the truth, and ſnorted a long night, not awaking thoſe whole thouſand yeers, that the ſunbeame of moſt wholeſome doctrine might ſhine upon them. And this is that Apoſtaſie which Paul ſaid should come, before the Lord should appeare, 2 Theſſ. 2.3. and which Iohn expreſſed before <hi>by the whole earth wondring after the Beaſt,</hi> chap. 13.3. and 17.8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ This is the firſt reſurrection:</hi> The third period, wherby is taught in what condition the Church should be by and by after thoſe thouſand yeeres were ended. More cleare truth should now at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth returne to the world: and the elect every where should aſſemble togither to the appearing light of it. Which earneſt deſire of theirs, is called <hi>the firſt reſurrection,</hi> to weet, in reſpect of the ſecond, ver. 12. as there we shal ſee. A greater number now then before, and with more vehement affections, should make haſt to the Ghoſpell, as came to paſſe at the end of thoſe thouſand yeeres, to weet, at the yeere 130. when very many, before dead in the Romiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitions, wherwith they were overwhelmed, opened their eyes at the riſing of the truth, &amp; ſo did riſe unto life from which of late they were ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. Among theſe wer numbred Marſilius Patavinus, Iohannes de Gauduno, Iohn Wickliefe, and many other excellent men of ſyncere godlines, and great learning for that time. By their labour others in great number wer recalled from their errours unto the truth, as it were from death to life, as we ſaid before in chap. 14.16. This wonderful converſion is called the <hi>firſt reſurrection,</hi> under the name wherof Iohn repeateth, and togither alſo declareth thoſe former times. This is not therfore the reſurrection at the laſt iudgement, as the Ieſuite interpreteth, who forgetting himſelfe in this verſe, extendeth now eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto the day of iudgement, the thouſand yeers,
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:6819:335"/> whoſe ende lately he did ſet in the comming of Antichriſt. What time then ſhalbe left for Antichriſt, not beginning his raigne before that the Dragon shalbe let out of priſon? Shal the firſt entry into his Kingdome fall on the day of iudgement? It were in deed to be wished, for ſo neither should he accomplish that three yeeres and halfe ſpace, which the Papiſts tell shalbe ſo miſerable, and bewaile ſo lamentably.

But whither then
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:6819:336"/> againe it shal ceaſe, ſecurity poſſeſsing men, until Chriſt shal come <hi>as a thiefe in the night,</hi> as it is foreshewed in the Ghoſpel, he to whom all things are known, knoweth.

Onely wee have ſeen three hundred yeeres now to have paſſed ſince this <hi>firſt reſurrection:</hi> and that every day, thankes be to God, the truth groweth mor in uſe. We muſt alſo yet tary ſom short ſpace before that our brethren the Iewes shal come to the faith. But after that they are come, and Chriſt shal have raigned ſome ages moſt gloriouſly on earth by his ſervants, in advancing his Church to moſt high honour abov all Empire, then alſo the Nations shal embrace true godlineſſe according to that ſaying, <hi>And the Gentils ſhal walke in the light therof, and the Kings of the earth ſhal bring their glory and honour unto it, &amp; the glory and the honour of the Gentils ſhalbe brought unto it,</hi> ſee chap. 21.24.26. For which cauſe it was promiſed to the Church of Philadelphia, <hi>that ſhee ſhould be a pillar in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and that ſhee ſhould goe out no more,</hi> chap. 3.12. that is, that it should have a firme &amp; ſtable abiding in the new glorious Church. VVhich Church of Philadelphia, we have shewed in the ſame place to be of the Gentils. From which it is proved, that the truth shal remaine for a long time yet among the Gentiles. For this is the Kingdome of Chriſt, when by the Scepter of his word he ruleth among any people. And this is the moſt true raign of any people, when it is ſubiect to the government of Chriſt alone, and is ruled by his onely diſpoſition. Now at length we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of what ſort that millenarie raigne is, of which we are a part, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes be to God; concerning which almoſt al the Fathers, Papias, Irenaeus, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Tertullian, Lactantius, and Auguſtine alſo in ſome part, ſpake ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny things and ſo highly. VVithout doubt they would have this Kingdom to be ſpiritual, whoſe unmeaſurable pleaſantnes they expreſſed by corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things after the manner of the Prophets. Yet nevertheleſſe I wil not deny that perhaps ſome leaned too much in their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the delights of the body: but was it to this end to overfill themſelves with them as men altogither loſt in riots, and given over to all dishoneſt pleaſures? It cannot be that any ſuch thing should ever come into the minde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holy men: but becauſe they knew that under this raign of Chriſt his Church should enioy very great felicity alſo of this life, they made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the abondance of ſuch pleaſures. VVhich we shortly expect, when the Romish Antichriſt and the Turke shalbe utterly abolished. Vntill this victory be gotten, the Church yet is in warre, liveth in tents, &amp; figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with many adverſaries. But after this warre is finished, shee shal keep a moſt ioyful triumph, and shal reioyce with perpetuall mirth. So as they
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:6819:337"/> ſwerved not much from the truth, who commended the holy pleaſures of this raign: unleſſe in this, that ſome ſuppoſed, that theſe thinges should be after the laſt reſurrection; wherin they greatly failed, when they added any earthly thing, to the eternal happines of the ſaints, which cannot be expreſſed or declared, by any earthly thing which here we doo enioy. But let us obſerve how greatly they are deceived, who almoſt doo determine a certaine yeere, and day of the laſt iudgement. The truth ſhal yet raigne among the Gentils for ſeven hundred yeeres: how long afterward amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, no calculation doth declare, as farre as I can find out: but this is in the power of God alone, altogither uncerten and unknown to every creature, as Chriſt expreſly teacheth, Mar. 13.32.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>But when the thouſand yeeres are expired:</hi> Such then was the condition of the godly, in the beginning and during the third period. Now he relateth partly what troubles Satan wrought being looſed; and partly what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he will yet cauſe. Firſt, he sheweth his looſing in this verſe, (for he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and is quiet at the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God,) which looſing was done after thoſe thouſand yeeres were accompliſhed. Not thoſe wherof he ſpak laſt in the end of the former verſe, but thoſe of which he made mention in the 2.3.4.5. verſes: of the beginning and end of which, we ſpake at the ſecond and third verſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Satan ſhalbe looſed out of his priſon:</hi> The open enemy ſhal then again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Church, as it came to paſſe in the riſing of the Turks, as we shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the third verſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>And ſhal goe out to deceive the nations:</hi> His firſt labour, being looſed, shal be in preparing an army, in this verſe: the endevour wherof is afterward propounded to be threefold, in the verſe folowing. The huge army shal be gathered, from many and ſundry countreys, as is shewed by <hi>the ſower corners of the earth: South, North, Eaſt, Weſt:</hi> In which foure quarters, ſeing the whole compaſſe of the earth is contained, leaſt any should think that this Empire doth extend even as farr &amp; amply, he comprehendeth thoſe foure corners within the limits &amp; bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of two nations, Gog and Magog; as though he should ſay, thinke yee not that the whole earth shall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſouldiers to make this wicked army; ſo much of the South, &amp; other parts of the earth, as ther are Provinces in the poſſeſsion of Gog and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog, shal helpe to the preparing of theſe hoſts. Therfore this power of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies shal conſiſt chiefly of theſe two ſortes of people. But what natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they are, can not be unknown, the Captaine being known. To the finding out of whom, the time doth lead, as by the hand. For he riſeth up after the thouſand yeeres of the Divels impriſonment; which time we hav proo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:6819:337"/> both often, and in many words, to come out at the yeere 130. And what other Divell, open enemy of the Church, came ther into the world, than that terrible Turke, who farr paſſed all the former in all cruelty? who notably executeth the fiercenes of the Divell, who knoweth that but a litle time remaineth for him of this looſing. Wherfore the Divell ſeemeth to rage even viſibly in the perſon of the Turke, whom he hath ordained for his Vice-Captaine. Therfore Gog and Magog are the nations that ar ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject to the Empire of the Turk, or at leaſt thoſe that miniſter armes unto him, for to performe his wicked entrepriſes. But yet ſo, as that Gog be the chiefe nations, and proper to the dominion of the Turk; as we learne from Ezechiel, who draweth his Prophecy chiefly againſt Gog, chap. 38. and 39. But Magog are perhaps the nations of an other juriſdiction: yet alwaies at hand to helpe the Turke. For Ezechiel inveigheth more lightly againſt him, as it were againſt a confederate, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chiefe authour As touching Gog, a Reubenite is rehearſed by this name, 1 Chron. 5.4. But who beſides the name, hath not likeneſſe to this, as is cleare fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe places of Ezechiel and the Revelation, in which onely, he now ſpoken off being excepted, mention is found of him. The moſt learned Tremelius &amp; Iunius doo think, that this name came of <hi>Gyge,</hi> who killed Candaules the Lydian, and raigned in his ſtead: from whence the leſſer Aſia was called Gog; even as afterward Croeſus enlarging the boundes of his Kingdome unto Syria, a certaine towne nigh Libanus was called <hi>Gygarta,</hi> for that which is <hi>Gog karta,</hi> that is, <hi>the City of Gog:</hi> for in the time that Ezechiel prophecied, eyther Halyartes or Croeſus, both the nephewes of Gyge, raigned in Aſia minor. Neither is it a new thing that the countre is should be ſignified by their chiefe Princes: eſpecially in the ſcriptures, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that every nation toke their names from hence at the firſt. Yet this perhaps hath place, rather in the firſt Princes, then in their ſucceſſours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that theſe alſo gave names to the countreies. But it was ſufficient for the Prophet to note the nation by the name of her firſt ſtock, which at that time bare rule in the ſame place, howſoever perhaps that countrey was not ſo called every where. Theſe things doo make this ſenſe very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. Yet notwithſtanding ſeing Ezechiel, with whom, this place (being wholly taken from thence) doth wel agree, maketh this Gog <hi>the chiefe Prince of Meſhech and Tubal,</hi> in chap. 38.3. that is, of the Capadocians and Iberians of Aſia, as Ioſephus teacheth lib. 1. chap. 6. of the Antiq. Neither was any of the poſterity of Gyge, no not Croeſus who raigned laſt and fartheſt, ever Prince of theſe countreies, whoſe dominion was limited by the River Halys, as Herodote relateth in Clio, ther is perhaps an other
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:6819:338"/> reaſon of this name. Which ſeemeth to be ſuch, that <hi>Gog</hi> is not an uſuall name of any nation, but a name made of <hi>Magog,</hi> that both it may note the great union of both peoples, and alſo that Gog doth ſpring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog. For Magog is the chiefe name of one of the ſonnes of Iaphet, who are reckoned to be <hi>Gomer, and Magog, and Maday, and Javan,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 10.2. And <hi>Gog</hi> is made therof by taking away the firſt ſyllable, that wee may know him to be a bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of the ſame ſtocke. But the countreys which Ezechiel attributeth unto him, were not ſubiect at that time to any ſuch Prince, but at length they were to be under the power of ſome ſuch, at which time that Prophecy should be performed: from which that <hi>Gog</hi> going out with violence as from the lifts, should make his firſt aſſault for the ſubduing of the other countreyes. As though he should ſay: behold I come againſt thee, o people, having thyne ofſpring from Magog: but who abideſt in the countreyes of Meshech and Tubal. By which he noteth out moſt fitly the Turks in their firſt originall. For theſe are Scythians by birth, who dwelled by the North ſide of the mount Caucaſe, as Zonaras writeth in the 3. tom. ad Conſtant. Pogonatum. VVho after that they were called into Perſia againſt the Saracenes, at length forſaking the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, brought under their power the Babylonians, &amp; almoſt the whole Eaſt, Armenia, Iberia, Cappadocia. Therfore the Scythian nation is the Turk, at length made Lord of Meshech &amp; Tubal, of the Cappadocians, &amp; Iberians. In which places he was at quiet until the Divel being looſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 130. yeere did ſeduce this natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; provoked them to make ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warre to the Church. For Andronicus Palaeologus being Emperour, he ſlew the Romane army in Paphlagonia, not leaving one alive: which gate being opened unto him, he paſſed through, even unto Sangarium, and made all the provinces from the ſea Poncus and Galatia, even unto the ſea of Lycia and Caria, and to the river Eurymedon, to be of his iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſee Niceph. Greg. lib. 5. Byzant. Hiſt. From hence was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of al miſeries; Ottoman riſing by and by after, by whom now for a long time hath the calamity of our world bin ſpred. So then was Gog ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, Prince onely of Meshech and Tubal, when firſt he began to goe on with rage, but to whom now all Aſia the leſſe, Syria, Meſopotamia, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, Iudea, Paleſtina, Aegypt, the Ilands, Graecia, Macedonia, Thracia, &amp; c, obey. Al which Provinces, after this tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny increaſed, do com in that ful largeneſſe under the name of Gog in the Prophet. But thou wilt ſay, what alliance hath Gog with Magog, if we grant him to be a Scythian by his ſtocke? A moſt nigh, both of kindred and nature. For Magog is a Scythian, and the Prince of that nation, as Ioſephus declareth in his firſt
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:6819:338"/> book and 5. chap. <hi>Magog,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was the authour of the Magogites, named of his name,</hi> which are called Scythians by the Greeks. But Sibyll deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing his countreyes, ſeemeth to prophecy another thing: <hi>woe woe be to thee ô land of Gog and Magog, compaſſed with the rivers of the Aethiopians.</hi> VVhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then is Magog between the Rivers of Aethiopia? But we know that theſe Southerne peoples are bordering on the ſea, and that this name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth not to any natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neerer the North then Aegypt, which ſometime is called Aethiopia, as Euſtatius on Dionyſius declareth. And without doubt this is that Aethiopia which Sibyll meaneth, which iuſtly she attributed to Magog. For who knoweth not that colonies of the Cereaſes Scithya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wer brought into Aegygt? where ther is alſo a town of their name? And alſo Ezechiel reckoneth the Perſians, Aethiopians, and Putei in the army of Gog, chap. 38 5. Therfore Sibyll deſcribeth not Magog by his proper countrey, but by a colonie ſent which shee chiefly maketh mention off, becauſe the calamity of Magog should moſt of all reſt upon that part of the earth. But let it be granted that Magog is a Scythian, how hath the Divell deceived him? In provoking him to ioyne his battels with the Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, and togither to attempt the deſtruction of Chriſtians. When firſt by the ſtreights of the Caſpian ſea, new troupes of Scythians had broken by force into the nigher Aſia, about the yeere 1250. Iohannes Duca being Emperour at Nice, they were trobleſome to the Turkes their kinſmen, who a few ages before came into thoſe countreyes, whom they drove out of the contreyes beyond Euphrates, into thoſe ſtreights of Armenia the leſſer, and Cappadocia, wherof we ſpake even now; ſo as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained neceſſarily to crave peace of the Roman Emperour, wherby they might reſiſt the inrodes of the Scythians, purſuing them at their backes. And this was the ſtate of things, until the time limited came, wherin the Divell should be looſed from his bondes. But then being let goe out of his priſon, he brake off this ſtrife between theſe two, and made one agree<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of their minds, for to aboliſh the Chriſtian name. Since that time the aide of the Scythians their countreymen hath never bin wanting to the Turk; in whoſe ſtrength at this day he truſteth greatly, as we ſee in the late expeditions into Hungary, where he had great armyes of the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who ar the natural Scythians, the ofſpring of Magog: Therfore the ſociety of Gog and Magog againſt the ſaincts, is evident in theſe dayes: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not kindred &amp; affinity of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſtock, but onely fraud &amp; deceit of the Divell aſſociated. Such then is the army of the Turks &amp; Scythians, both indeed of the ſame originall: but of both, theſe are called Gog, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are deſcendded from Magog, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a river from the fountaine,
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:6819:339"/> although now they be the princes of this warfarre, neither retaine they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing now of the Scythians, becauſe of their long ſciourning in Aſia, but onely ſome footſteps of the former name. But theſe partly newly come from Scythia, partly the inhabitants at this day, but called into theſe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>treyes, as neceſsity requireth, delight yet in the name of their firſt Prince. The number of this army is almoſt infinite: <hi>for it is as the ſand of the Sea,</hi> that is, exceeding great and innumerable, being defined before to be <hi>of two thouſand hundred thouſand,</hi> in chap. 9.16. in both places is ſignified an huge multitude. But what Emperour but the Turk, goeth to battell with ſo po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pulous an army? Scarce all the Chriſtian armies ioyned togither in any expedition, doo equalize the fourth part of it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>They went up therfore into the plame of the earth:</hi> In the former verſe wee ſpak of a threfold e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>devour of this muſtered army: the firſt of which is this <hi>going up into the plaine of the earth;</hi> wherby is ſignifyed the ſame thing which was expreſſed before by <hi>the third part of men killed,</hi> chap. 9.15. But this ſo expreſſe mention of the <hi>latitude,</hi> declareth that this tyranny shal overſpred much more in <hi>breadth</hi> then in <hi>length.</hi> For Aegypt being ſubdued, &amp; a great part of Africk, and toward the North, even to the borders of the Tartari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans; this their Empire exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth no leſſe it ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the South unto the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtrion, yea farr more, then was once belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the Empire of Rome. From the Eaſt to the Weſt, they have ſcarce attained any more then the third part. Moreover they have had ſo eaſy and ready a conqueſt hitherto, that iuſtly they may be ſaid to go up upon the breadth, who have brought under their power many countreyes, rather by travelling over them, then wearying them with any long and doubtful warre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they compaſſed the tents of the Saints:</hi> The ſecond endevour is the aſſaulting of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, in which the Saints dwel.

For the Saincts are yet in campe under their tents, and shal not have an end of the warrefare till before that the mariage be come: at the ſolemnization wherof, they ſhal caſt off their ſouldiers caſſocke, and shal put on more ioyful garments, meet for ſo great mirth.</p>

For howſoever the holy city was above granted to the Gentiles to be troden under foote a thouſand two hundred three ſcore dayes, chap. 11.2. and the ſame againe was renewed (after that time was paſt) in the CHVRCHES, which in theſe laſt times are reformed according to
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:6819:339"/> the rule of the divine truth; yet it is not to be doubted off, but that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved city is for excellency ſake, that multitude of the beleeving Iewes, who now at length shal shortly be ioyned to the company of the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in Chriſt. The iudgment that followeth, doth require it should be ſo, wherby the Turk endevouring to conquere this city, shal upon a ſudden be overwhelmed. But where and when this ſiege shall happen, may be gathered from thoſe things which have bin ſpoken before. The place ſhalbe <hi>Hartſebhi,</hi> the mountaine of beauty, the Oriental <hi>armagedon,</hi> the very land of Iudea. So Daniel chap. 11.45. and elegantly Ezechiell chap. 38.8. <hi>After many dayes thou ſhalt be viſited. For in the latter yeeres thou ſhalt come into the land that is come home ſafe from the ſword, and is gathered out of many peoples, thou ſhalt invade the mountaines of Iſrael, which have long bin waſt: with it being brought out of the peoples, all ſhal dwel ſafe.</hi> The time shalbe at the end of a thouſand three hundred thirty five yeeres, of which Daniel ſpeaketh in chap. 12.12. when the houre, day, moneth, and yeere of the Turks tyranny ſhal come out, to weet, at the yeere a thouſand ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninetith more or leſſe. But of theſe things now briefly, perhaps oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion shalbe given at an other time to declare them more at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ But fire came down from God:</hi> The laſt deſtruction followeth, and firſt, of the army, in this verſe; which God by ſome extraordinary way, ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtroy utterly. For from heaven he ſhal powre out his wrath upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of the Turkes; as before chap. 16.21. and more largely in Ezechiel chap. 38.18.19. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>And the Divill that deceived them:</hi> The Emperour himſelfe the Turk not onely in reſpect of his owne perſon, but alſo of the whole ſtate &amp; ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of his Empire. For ther shal not be any more, either Emperour or name of Turke. But the word <hi>Divil</hi> is uſed by a figurat if kind of ſpeach of the principal cauſe, for the inſtrumental: which is very ſignificant in this place, shewing that not onely this one enemy the Turk ſhalbe deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that no ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemy shall ariſe ever after. For the Divell, by whoſe labour they are rayſed up, shal not be thruſt into priſon againe for ſome time, but for ever he shalbe caſt into the lake of fire, never to goe out for to raiſe up any ſuch new troubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Where was alſo that Beaſt and that falſe Prophet:</hi> Therfore all ar in a like condition, which are punished with the like punishment. The name of Chriſtian maketh no difference between the Turke and the Roman Anti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chriſt, unleſſe perhaps for to encreaſe his punishment, for aſmuch as he had a greater meanes of truth and grace. But obſerve, that the Beaſt &amp; the Falſe Prophet were already deſtroied, as alſo their deſtruction hath bin
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:6819:340"/> declared before, to whom at length that Divell is added, a partaker of the ſame puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And they ſhalbe tormented:</hi> The vulgarlatine tranſlation omitteth the copulative coniunction, and ioyneth the verbe, <hi>ſhalbe tormented,</hi> next with <hi>Beaſt and Falſe Prophet:</hi> but amiſſe, conſidering tha it is no leſſe neceſſary to underſtand that the common puniſhment of them all shalbe eternall, then that the puniſhment shalbe one and the ſame.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>Then I ſaw a great white throne:</hi> Thus farre concerning the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the enemies; the <hi>happines</hi> followeth, which the Church ſhall enioy after all theſe ſtormes are driven away. The firſt part of it is, <hi>the gathering togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Saints,</hi> in the reſt of this chapter. Which gathering is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>the reſurrection of the dead, and the iudgement given touching them.</hi> For, by the moſt learned mens leave, I doo think that this reſurrection, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeved, ſo farre as I ſee, of all men, to be that laſt reſurrection of the bodies of all men, who ſince the death of the firſt Adam doo ſleepe in the graves, perteineth to no other thing, then to the full reſtoring of the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation. Not that I deſire to ſet a broach new opinions, &amp; profer them to the world, or becauſe it delighteth mee to goe againſt the conſent of al men, (I hope that ſuch proud &amp; impudent raſhnes is farr from mee; and God is my witnes how I deteſt that itching deſire of ſearching out &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging new errours, through a loathing of auncient truth,) but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole order of things, &amp; the merveilous conſent of the reſt of the ſcriptures doo compell mee to follow this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which thing I have thought good to relate in a few words, that it may appeare to all men by what meanes I am brought into this opinion: that if they shall have any weight for the truth, wee may gaine the knowledge of a thing not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly known before: but if they ſhal not be firme and ſound, they may be thruſt through by the cenſures of the godly; and I my ſelf at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth may be freed from this errour, of what ſorte ſoever it be. Firſt therfore, when I diligently weighed thoſe things, which in the next chapter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are rehearſed to be after this reſurrection, I ſaw that they agreed by no meanes to the heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s properly ſo called, but to have place onely on earth. Of which ſorte are that <hi>this holy city commeth down from God out of heaven:</hi> that <hi>ſhee is a ſpouſe prepared onely, and adorned for her husband,</hi> not yet give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that <hi>the hope of reward is put off unto the time to come:</hi> ver. 7. that <hi>one of the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels ſheweth her to John,</hi> ver. 10. of which ſorte of miniſtery, ther ſhall be none in heaven. The very name alſo of which Angel being but heard, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is one of thoſe ſeven which ar appointed chiefe actours in the laſt plagues, ch. 15. may declare within what bounds we ar converſant.
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:6819:340"/> VVhither alſo <hi>ſhal the Apoſtles make the foundation of the wall of the holy city in heaven,</hi> when Chriſt delivereth up the Kingdome to his Father? Or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſhall the Kings of the earth bring their glory to the Church in heaven?</hi> Or ſhal any thing <hi>redound from hence to the health of the nations?</hi> Theſe things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and many other of the like ſorte, conſidering that they shalbe after this reſurrection, drove mee to another interpretation, and chiefly to that which the natural force of the words manifeſted. For I remembred, that the calling of the Iewes openly and often in the ſcriptures, is called <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead,</hi> as in Paul, <hi>for if the caſting away be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiving be but life from the dead?</hi> that is, as Oecumenius ſaith, among other interpretations, <hi>what ſhal the receiving of them be, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wee ſay, that he quickeneth them being dead in ſinnes which receiveth: to weet God.</hi> VVell and agreably to the Apoſtles mind, iudging that the very receiving of the Iewes should be life from the dead. Moſt learned Theod. Beza ſo interpreteth, as if the Apoſtle should ſay after a proverbial manner of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king, that it shal come to paſſe, that when the Iewes shall come to the Goſpel, the world shalbe as it were revived, by an argument of things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. But I forbeare to heape togither interpretations. The very words of the Apoſtle are plaine ynough of themſelves. The ſecond place is out of Iſay chap. 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhal live againe, my dead bodies ſhal riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: awake ye that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of hearbes, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead.</hi> In the former chapters the Prophet hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed the deſolation of the whole earth: ſeverally of certaine nations, from the twelft chapter, and of al togither in the chap. 24. But ſeeing this renewing of the Iewes which he ſpeaketh of, ſhalbe after that Babylon is overthrowne, and the ſame ſuch, as wherby the Lord <hi>will ſwallow up death into victory, and wipe away teares from all faces,</hi> as chap. 25.8. it muſt needes be that this ful reſtoring is yet looked for to be fulfilled, and not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed paſt in thoſe ſmaller deliverances, which came to this people lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g agoe. Eſpecially conſidering that ther is a more expreſſe noting of the time in thoſe things which follow next, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>that in that day he ſhall viſit Leviathan, that long and crooked SERIENT, and the DRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GON which is in the Sea,</hi> in Iſaiah chapter 27. ver. 1. by which words he ſignifyeth not the Babylonian, (for he was farre remooved from the ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) but without all doubt the Turke, whom likeweiſe our holy Apoſtle Iohn agreably unto it, calleth a <hi>SERPENT</hi> and <hi>DRAGON. This,</hi> is worthy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly called a <hi>long SERPENT,</hi> the boundes and limites of his Empire being ſpread and extended ſo farre abroad: and no leſſe inſtly ſaid to be <hi>crooked,</hi> if an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="666" facs="tcp:6819:341"/>
               <p>For we may conſider the knob <hi>head</hi> to be in Greece, Macedonie, Thracia and the other nations of Europe; his ſome what ſtretched out <hi>body</hi> to be in Aſia the leſſe, called at this day Anatolie: afterward his <hi>belly</hi> bowed &amp; going in circuit by Syria &amp; Phoenicia: as Dionyſius writeth moſt elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Gulfe Iſsicus: <hi>As a Dragon cruell in lookes is wrapped about round cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, ſlowe.</hi> Laſt of all his <hi>tayle</hi> following with a long train through Aegypt, and the coaſt of Lybia, and gathering it ſelfe as it were into a circle. This Serpent goeth not with ſtraite paſſes, but bowing himſelfe into many crooked circuits, thruſteth forward his very body. Who is he that behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Empire, not ſo much ſtretching it ſelfe in length, as going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a crooked winding, may not perceive the lively image of the crooked ſerpent? It is not my purpoſe to hunt after vaine ſubtilties, but to bring onely the truth, as farr as I ſee, that figure of the Serpent, which the Spirit hath repreſented to us. There is added the habitation of this <hi>ſerpent to be in the Sea,</hi> for which cauſe he is called <hi>Leviathan</hi> or <hi>Whale.</hi> How wonderfully doth this agree to the Turk, who hath fixed the ſeate of his Empire in the very mouth of the Sea Pontus and Propontide; to weet Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantinople? Therfore when God shal call to an account <hi>this Serpent</hi> &amp; <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> that is, when he shal utterly abolish the Turkish name, then shall this <hi>reſurrection</hi> be. For the Prophet ioyned togither theſe two things, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>thy dead ſhall live againe, and at that time the Lord ſhal viſit Leviathan with his moſt ſharpe ſword:</hi> the next chapter beginning by an oppoſition of the time, in which he will beſtow that benefit, which he mentioned in the end of the former. So Iohn in this place next after the deſtruction of the Turks, addeth this reſurrection. The third place is in the 37. chap. of Eze<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chiel, where, what other thing are <hi>the dry bones, the ſlaine, and the graves,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes afflicted and overwhelmed with all kind of miſeries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Who should have no greater ability to deliver themſelves from that ruine, than have the dead and buried to riſe out of their graves. And what other thing are the <hi>ſinewes, fleſh, skinne, Spirit,</hi> than a future reſtoring at length? Which shalbe no leſſe acceptable an wel come, as almoſt is a new life of a ſleep in the graves. <hi>Behold, ſaith the Lord Iehovah, I will open your gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ves, and draw you out of your ſepulchres, my people, and bring you backe into the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Iſraell: that you may know, that J am the Lord, when I doo open your graves, &amp; bring you out of your ſepulchres, ô my people,</hi> ver. 12.13. To what end should they be brought againe into the land of Iſrael after the laſt reſurrection? our dwelling place shal then be in heaven, not in earth. Moreover, that reſurrection which Ezechiel ſpeaketh of, shalbe by degrees, and by little and little, ver. 8.9.10. But the general reſurrection shalbe <hi>in a moment, in
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:6819:341"/> the twinckling of an eye,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.52. Furthermore <hi>theſe bones</hi> are <hi>the whole houſe of Iſraell,</hi> ver. 11. and now ſhalbe the uniting togither of Iudah &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, which thoſe two peeces of wood ioyned togither into one doo declare. Which things belong properly to the Iſraelites, neither alſo paſt, but to come, as that happines sheweth, which is mentioned in the ende of the chapter, greater then any, that the dayes paſt can chaleng. But how doth that agree, that togither with this reſurrection, is conioyned the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quering of Gog and Magog, chap. 38. and 39? unles that here the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection goeth before; in Iohn in this place, it followeth, the cauſe wherof wee will shew by and by. Neither doo I doubt, but Daniel hath meant the ſame thing <hi>by thoſe many of them that ſleepe in the duſt of the earth awoking, ſome to everlaſting life, ſome to ſhame and perpetual contempt,</hi> chap. 12.23. For <hi>many</hi> are not <hi>all:</hi> but this word ſeemeth to have bin uſed of ſet purpoſe, that a difference might be ſet between the generall and this reſurrection. He attributeth alſo the chiefe honour <hi>to them that teach and iuſtify others,</hi> not ſo much for labours paſt in their life time, as for their preſent travell and induſtry. For <hi>they that teach,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall ſhine,</hi> not they which taught long a goe. None of which things, wee know, shalbe after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For brevity ſake I will not examine, how that of Hoſea 13, 14. belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth alſo to this. Seeing therfore the ſcriptures doo ſo freely uſe ſo expres a ſimilitude of the reſurrection, to ſignify the reſtoring of the Iewes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo wee find a thing of ſo great moment elſe where fully declared in this book; wee hope that wee doo no violence to the truth, if that we ſhal ioyne this place unto the meaning of other the like. But ſome man wil ſay that wee have made mention of this calling in the former chapter: it is true, but that <hi>of the ſixt viall</hi> was but begun, not perfit and abſolute, as that of the <hi>laſt viall</hi> shall be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the enemies shalbe deſtroyed. VVhich diſtinction of calling the former words doo manifeſt, when in that firſt, Iohn was commanded <hi>to write, bleſſed are they which are called to the marriage ſupper of the Lambe,</hi> chap. 19.9. VVherby it is taught that the <hi>firſt</hi> was not perfit, where need was of ſuch confirmation: the office wherof is to ſeale up a thing not yet ſufficiently known, and to come; which, all being called had bin ſuperfluous. But Daniel writeth moſt plainly, who hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished both the callings by their times. He ſetteth the firſt at the ende <hi>of a thouſand two hundred ninetie daies.</hi> The ſecond at the ende of <hi>a thouſand three hundred and five.</hi> The diſtance between both is of fourty five dayes, that is of ſo many yeeres, as in an other place with Gods helpe wee will shew. Dan. 12.11.12. VVee shall ſee likeweiſe in Ezechiel in the place before ſpoken off, <hi>that the dry bones being covered with fleſh and skinne, did
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:6819:342"/> move themſelves alike, and approach one to an other.</hi> Moreover, after ſome time, during which they were deſtitute of Spirit, at length being quickened by the ſame, doo live a true life, and doo performe all thoſe offices of life peculiar unto bodies endued with ſoules. That <hi>approaching</hi> of the dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is that firſt calling of the former chapter. The <hi>comming to of the Spirit,</hi> giving to thoſe bones perfit life, is the latter calling, this reſurrection to which nothing shalbe wanting unto perfit ſalvation. Both which, though Ezechiel comprehendeth in the ſame chapter, yet he handleth the more diſtinctly afterward. For firſt, before that warre with Gog and Magog, he mentioneth the reſurrection, as alſo Iohn that which was begun in the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer chapter: afterward when Gog was deſtroyed, he deſcribeth a moſt glorious building of the temple in the 40. chapter &amp;c. which is this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and full reſurrection. Therfore the firſt reſurrection of the Iewes, (of the Iewes I ſay, for the firſt reſurrection of this chapter ver. 5. is of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, into which notwithſtanding shal fall at length this firſt of the Iewes, that every way it may be the firſt,) shalbe by and by after the deſtruction of Rome. The ſecond shalbe ſtraite after the Romish Pope and the Turke be deſtroyed. This <hi>reſurrection</hi> is a power to enter into the temple, which <hi>the ſmooke did hinder to all untill all the ſeven laſt plagues were accompliſhed,</hi> ch, 15. the which is ſpent in deſtroing the Pope of Rome and the Turke, as was ſpoken ſufficiently before. If I ſeeme to any, to weaken the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neral re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſurrection, by taking ſo notable a foundation from it, let him underſtand that it taketh no dammage from hence. This place hath yet left a moſt ſtrong ground to confirme the ſame. For the Spirit doth not deceiv with a fained ſimilitude, but of which ought to be a moſt certen perſuaſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians. Otherweiſe certenly he had loſt his labour, if he had brought any thing lacking credit. Moreover he should have driven to def<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peration, in propounding that which muſt not be done: for they would have thought, that even ſo they had bin paſt hope: but uſing a tipe of a thing that should moſt certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly come to paſſe in his time, he both maketh the calling undoubted, and alſo declareth the manner, wherby at length the reſurrection shalbe accomplished. And thus much of the true ſenſe of this argument: now we wil proſecute the reſt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Then I ſaw a great white throne:</hi> The preparation of God the iudge, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his people at liberty, taken from a ſimilitude of the general reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

<pb n="669" facs="tcp:6819:342"/> gratious, moſt comfortable, in the very forme having a demonſtration of mercy. <hi>Great,</hi> to declare the moſt imperial maieſty of God, which now shalbe made evident in this aſſembly of his people: he <hi>ſitteth alſo upon a thro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne,</hi> ready to iudge, becauſe ther shalbe no more any delay of rewarding: the ſtay wherof before brought men into that opinion, as if God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the earth: there <hi>fled from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, both earth and heaven:</hi> a great alteration of al things being made, both the falſe Church plucked up by the rootes, and alſo the true augmented with ſo great fruitfulnes, that her former ſorrowful face may ſeem to have fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>And J ſaw the dead both ſmal and great:</hi> Such then was the iudgment: now at deſcribed thoſe that shalbe iudged.

It may come to paſſe that ſome may fall ſome time through humane infirmitie, but holy admonitions, and wholſome correction shal bring them againe to good thrift and repentance.

               <p n="1">1 <hi>After J ſaw a new heauen:</hi> The opinion of the reſurrection from the ende of the former chapter, hath mooved very many to interpret al theſe things of the Church as it shalbe at length in heaven. But wee have shewed, that neither the laſt reſurrection is intreated of there, neithe doth the Spirit deſcribe here to us the Angelical bleſſedneſſe of the Saincts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, but of them yet converſing upon the earth, as the thinges which are mentioned doo manifeſt in their places.</p>
               <pb n="674" facs="tcp:6819:345"/>
               <p>Neither perhaps is it needfull that the heavenly inheritance should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with words, which all know wel ynough to ſurmount any praiſes whatſoever, even they alſo, in whoſe eyes the Church on earth is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weiſe deſpiſed: but concerning this, her eſtimation is leſſe with mortall men then ought to be, becauſe shee is a ſtranger: wherupon ther may hav bin a neceſſary reaſon to ſet forth more largely the glory and dignity of it. The deſcriptron wherof notwithſtanding, maketh a way to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende in minde that celeſtial happineſſe. For if the magnificence of the ſpouſe be ſo great on earth, of what ſort are thoſe things, which God hath prepared for his with himſelfe? But the mind is weakened at the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this, let us therfore turne our eyes aſide to this earthly pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, greater indeed then all words can ſet forth, yet more capable to our ſenſes, and which within a few yeeres ſhalbe made clare to the world. The interpretation of the new heaven and earth may be taken out of that to the Hebrewes chap. 12.26. <hi>whoſe voice then ſhooke the earth; but now hath de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared ſaying, yet once more will I ſhake not onely the earth, but the heaven:</hi> where to shake heaven and earth, by the interpretation of the Apoſtle himſelfe, is to abolish the old manner of worship and people. For heaven by tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation is the temple, and whole legal worship, wherof that temple was the ſeate and place where it abode long, as Heb. 8.5. From whence to shake heaven, is to aboliſh that worship. The earth are men, and more properly the Iſraelites, a people to whom that legal worship did belong. Therfore to ſhake the earth, is to shake the Iſraelites, &amp; to remove them out of their place. Neither hath the common uſe of ſpeaking through this book digreſſed any whit from this ſignification of the words, where heaven is the more pure Church, the earth, the degenerate citizens, as we have ſeen in their places. Even as God therfore in the firſt comming of his ſonne shooke the heaven and the earth in reiecting that old both wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship and people, and ordaining and chooſing a new, ſo againe when it shal pleaſe him to have mercy on the forſaken nation, and to beſtow upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſalvation by Chriſt, he shal darken the former glory of heaven &amp; earth, making the dignity and honour of his new people ſo famous, as if he had created all things a new. Vherunto belongeth that of Iſaiah: <hi>For behold I will create a new heaven, and a new earth,</hi> as thoug he should ſay, I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a moſt pure manner of worshiping mee, and wil take unto mee a new people, in whoſe aſſembly I wilbe honoured, chap. 65.17. Of which ſort is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>If any be in Chriſt, he is a new creature, old things ar paſſed away, all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>

                  </gap> as we ſaid even now. How this should be abolished, it may be doubtfull becauſe of thoſe things which wee have mentioned before. As concerning the earth, it is not ſo doubtfull, conſidering that the Spirit hath already taught ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that the Pope of Rome with his whole (falſely ſo called) Catholique flock, shalbe rooted out utterly before this day. As then tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reformed Church, shal the receiving of the Iewes, cauſe the alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Gentils, as before time the caſting away of them, was the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conciling of the world? Rom. 11.15. It may ſeem ſo in deed, eſpecially conſidering that the Apoſtle affirmeth in the ſame place, that a certain ful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of the Gentils shalbe accomplished, as is like at the calling of the Iewes ver. 25. but yet notwithſtanding in this very chapter, the Revelation teacheth otherweiſe, to weet, that the Gentils, which shalbe ſaved, ſhall walke in the light of it, and the Kings of the earth shal bring their glory and honour to the new Ieruſalem, ver. 24. Yea Paul in the place before ſaid, plainly avoucheth, that the Church shalbe very flouriſhing amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Gentils, when the Iewes are called: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if the caſting away of the Iewes, be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the reconciling be, but life from the dead?</hi> This is as if he should ſay, what shall the receiving be, but as it were a general reſurrection, wherby they that are dead in ſinns among all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comming at length to the truth, shalbe made partakers of eternall life by faith in Chriſt? From which wee gather that the fulneſſe of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils is not a certaine ende of beleeving, at the calling of the Iewes, ſo that faith among the Gentiles afterward should utterly periſh, (eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as no more can be powred into a full veſſell,) but a more aboundant acceſſe of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth toward what part ſoever their countreyes doo extend, obeying the Kingdome of Chriſt, according to that ſaying: <hi>the Lord ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be King over the whole earth: in that day ſhall ther be one Lord, and his name ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be one,</hi> Zach. 14.9. <hi>And the Lord will deſtroy in this mountaine the figure of this vaile that is ſpred upon all nations, and the cover wherwith all nations are covered. he will ſwallow up death it ſelfe into victory, and the Lord Iehovah ſhal wipe away the tears from all faces, and will take away the reproach of his people out of all the earth,</hi> Iſaiah chap. 25.7.8. <hi>For then they that dwell in the wilderneſſe ſhall kneele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and his enemies ſhall licke the duſt.

But that ſeemeth to be repugnant to this calami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty of Europe, that after the <hi>firſt reſurrection, there are a thouſand yeeres of reigne with Chriſt,</hi> chap. 20.6. that is, ther shalbe among thoſe nations, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this reſurrection hath befallen, a continuance of the truth by the ſpace of ſo many yeeres from the beginning of the reſtauration therof. But wee know that this was proper to our countreyes. But it may be anſwered, that perhaps this reigne shalbe ſuch as was that of the thouſand yeeres before that reſurrection, when the Divell was bound, chap. 20.4. when the Kingdome was of a few elect, in whoſe hart was the love of the onely ſalvation-bringing truth, howſoever the Antichriſtian impiety ſavoured better to all the reſt of the multitude. Certenly other ſcriptures ſeeme to leane more this way, threatning that al religion shalbe ſo defiled, with ſo many corruptions, that fearce any wholeſome footſtep of it shall remaine entire. And who is ſo ignorant of things, that hath not iuſt cauſes inough to feare much, eſpecially when he ſeeth the word of God to be deſpiſed every where, new errours to ſpring up daily, old to be brought back again from hell, al godlineſſe to be converted into gaine and ambition? Many indeed are the arguments that the glory of God wil depart from us ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as once from the temple at Ieruſalem, Ezech. 9.3. Vnleſſe peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome comfort ariſeth from hence, that this departure <hi>of the firſt heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth</hi> may be underſtood not of the utter decay of the truth among
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:6819:346"/> the <hi>Europeans,</hi> but of ſuch a renewing among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in compariſon of the excellency wherof, whatſoever was excellent before, may be ſaid to have paſſed and vanished away; <hi>when the light of the moone shalbe as the light of the ſunne, and the light of the Sunne ſevenfold, as the light of ſeven dayes, &amp; the Sunne ſhall bluſh when the Lord ſhall reigne in Sion:</hi> as wee have heard out of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah; or finally unleſſe it hath ſome weight, that the Spirit here ſpeaketh ſo exquiſitely, not ſaying the former heaven and former earth were paſſed away, but the <hi>firſt heaven and the firſt earth,</hi> as though theſe words reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not the Gentiles at all, but onely the legall worship, which rightly one may call the firſt heaven, ordained at the firſt of God himſelfe. But the Chriſtian people of the Gentils, was neither the firſt people of God, neither were the rites obſerved by them, the firſt ordinances delivered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven. As though the words should give this ſenſe at laſt, albeit this peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes al the time of their reiection, thirſted after their old cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and worship, and boaſted openly that they should have at length free leave to uſe their auncient cuſtome, (which we know they vaunt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in theſe dayes,) yet in this reſtoring, they shall conforme themſelves wholly to the will of God in ſuch ſorte, that willingly renouncing their old ordinances, which then they shall acknowledge to have received an ende in Chriſt, they shal make manifeſt to all men, that <hi>the firſt heaven and earth,</hi> which they looked for in vaine <hi>were paſſed away for ever.</hi> This laſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be of no ſmall force, to ſhewe that the reaſon of the order <hi>of the firſt heaven and earth</hi> should not be between the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils and Iewes, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the Legal and Chriſtian Iewes.

               <p>A notable place againſt the blaſphemous doctrine of the Papiſts touching merit. The Ieſuite laboureth to ſhift it off, making the ſame ſenſe of it, as of that of the Rom, 8.18. <hi>The ſufferings of this time are not worthy of the glory to come, which ſhalbe revealed in us:</hi> by which words, ſaith he, our good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts ar not compared with the future bleſſedneſſe, but the ſufferings, that is, the labours which we ſuffer for Gods ſake: as though he should ſay, our ſorowes cannot be compared with the joyes of the bleſſed: although the endurings of griefes, in as much as they come from grace, are worthy doubtleſſe of eternal life. Conſider the fraude of the Ieſuite, who having nothing to anſwer to this place, flyeth to an other, from whence ſome shew of an anſwer might be taken. But that I may not now examine that of the Romanes, why telleth he us of ſorowes and af lictions not to be compared with the ioyes of the bleſſed, of which nothing at al is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this place? Here teares, death, ſorow, crying, all labour is baniſhed away, before in ver. 4. ſo as nothing is more unmeet as to dreame of ſuch a compariſon. For in theſe words it is shewed that not onely the ſorowes of this life are inferiour to the ioyes of the bleſſed, but alſo that the thirſt, hunger, and moſt fervent deſire of godlineſſe, than which nothing can be of greater eſteeme in a man, doo not obtaine life by their merit, but by the meere grace &amp; mercy of God. Neither is that of the fained Ambroſe leſſe frivolous, and alſo of Thomas, and Rupert, who wil have the word <hi>freely</hi> therfore to be ſaid, <hi>becauſe although eternall life be due to the merits of the righteous condignly, yet the merits themſelves could not have bin merits without grace, which was given freely.</hi> For if they would rather have ſpoken with the Holy Ghoſt, then from their owne perverſe braines, they would never have ſaid, that any grace is given to men, by whoſe helpe they might doo workes worthy of eternal life, when here it is ſaid expreſſely, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the moſt excellent workes is alto gither freely beſtowed, and not condignly.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things:</hi> For none shal attaine to this happineſſe, but he which shall behave himſelfe valiantly in that battell, with the Dragon, of which in the former chapter.

But theſe <hi>ſinners</hi> are alone with <hi>abominable;</hi> men notably wicked and deſperate. But why is ther mention of Idolaters, when al the Iewes generally doo hate Idols. It may be that ſome have turned away to the Romish impiety, although this be a rare thing: ioint alſo that Rome before this time shall be deſtroyed. Therfore theſe things may be underſtood of the Gentiles, as alſo al other kinds of ſinnes which have bin reckoned hitherto, who cleaving to their Idols shal have no part in this holy city; of wich in the meane time al the godly shalbe freedenizens, wherſoever they shal live. <hi>Lyars</hi> alſo are excluded, that is, ſuch as reioyce in lying, as hypocrites, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers, and they who make ſome shew of religion, having no taſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of n their hart. Obſerve how with thoſe horrible ſinnes he mixeth ſome leſſer, in the common opinion: that no man should deceive himſelfe, by ſuppoſing that if he refraine himſelfe from thoſe greater, he may followe the ſmaller without danger of punishment. But the thing is nothing ſo, he that continueth in the leaſt without repentance, muſt know that a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is prepared for him in the lake of fire: hither shalbe thruſt al this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and they who are of the ſame condition. Not becauſe al the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked shal deſcend preſently at that time into hel: but becauſe they shalbe convinced and condemned by the ſentence of the holy Church, which is as if God should pronounce it from heaven, and should ſtrait way drawe the condemned unto torment.</p>

But we ſee theſe things yet a farr off and darkly, the day at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth shal make this thing moſt cleare.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>And he tooke mee up by the Spirit into a great and hie mountaine:</hi> He entreh into the deſcription of the city, more fully then before: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting shorter in theſe two verſes. Therfore that Iohn might throughly knowe the bride, he is taken up into a hie and lofty mountaine. The firſt condemnation of the whore was ſeen in the wilderneſſe, chap. 17.3. but the glory of the bride shalbe revealed in a hie mountaine, in the eyes and light of the whole world. This mountaine ſeemeth to be that which Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah ſpeaketh of; <hi>In the laſt times the mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhalbe ſet in the top of other mountaines, and exalted above the hilles, that all nations may flow unto it,</hi> chap. 2.2. VVorthily is this mountaine called great and hie, which is ſet in the higheſt toppe and height of other mountaines. Therfore what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoever excelleth in dignity on earth, the excellency of this Church shall paſſe it. In this mountaine shalbe ſeen the beauty of this city; as if her ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyzens dwelling within the walles should pereeive moſt plainly her reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and divine worthines, which cannot be ſo manifeſt to them that dw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el farther off in remote countreyes. And many Iohns, that is, godly and holy men, leaving their places of abode shal flee unto this mountaine, not that being ſuperſtitious they may viſit holy places, but that face to face they may behold the glory of the Lord; and enioy being preſent the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſaints. For can any thing be more longed for, then to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with them, which shal worship Chriſt moſt purely and moſt holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to his ordinance alone and with moſt fervent affections? It shalbe certenly an excellent patterne of our felowship with the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. But it is ſufficient to touch theſe things in a word, leaſt I may ſeeme to ſome men to delight my ſelfe with a ſweet dreame. But let us obſerve, that if theſe things should be ſpoken of the ſaints countrey after the laſt iudgement, no Olypus would be high ynough to shewe it manifeſtly.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>And he ſhewed mee that great city:</hi> This city is great and moſt ful of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens: hitherto it hath bin alwayes contained within a ſmal number of
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:6819:350"/> men; now firſt of al called <hi>great,</hi> her boundes being inlarged, and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a ful multitude. It ſhalbe farre more glorious in this reſpect, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the more common good ſurmounteth it ſelfe. But beſide theſe shee is <hi>holy, and commeth downe out of heaven from God.</hi> Of which things we have ſeen before, This is a new thing, that shee <hi>is adorned with the glory of God,</hi> that is, that shee hath the preſence of God manifeſted in her by a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine glorious beauty, as it is declared in thoſe things that follow. To this ende the <hi>temple</hi> before <hi>was filled with ſmoke,</hi> after the old manner of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the tabernacle and temple, but now there shalbe an other way. God shal give a more cleare shew of his maieſty, then ever before this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, either with the Iewes, or Chriſtian Gentils. Moreover alſo <hi>it hath a light which is like to a ſtone moſt pretious</hi> &amp;c. What is this light? Not any brightneſſe with which the city shineth by her owne purity, (although of it ſelfe it shalbe moſt beautiful,) but a light which is conveyed into it from an other. For ſo <hi>Phoſter</hi> ſignifieth, to weet, ſuch a thing as ſendeth forth light from it ſelfe, as the Sunne. Moone, Starres, candle, torch &amp; the like. Therfore the Grecians tranſlate theſe wrds of Gen. 1, 16. <hi>tous duo Phoſteras tous megalous, thoſe two great lights:</hi> And alſo Paul, <hi>Phaineſthe hos Phoſteres, ſhine yee as ſtarres,</hi> Phil. 2.15. Therfore the <hi>Phoſter</hi> of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is that which giveth light to the city, the which light shee draweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other, and hath it not naturally. From whence then is it miniſtred? From the very glory of God, for theſe thinges depend on the next before going, as though he should ſay; I ſawe the City having the glory of God, which glory of God being the light of it, was like a ſtone moſt pretious, &amp;c. which interpretation is affoarded by the 23 verſe after, where the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of lighting the city is given to the glory of GOD.</p>
               <p>But why is this light like to a ſtone moſt pretious, and not rather like to the Sunne, or Starres? Becauſe perhaps the light of the Sunne doth burne, and blindeth the eyes, rather more agreable with an overthwart looking upon it, then a direct. The shinning of the ſtone is altogither harmeleſſe, very much grateful and pleaſant; yee the more that one loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth upon it, the more agreable it is; in which reſpect it repreſenteth moſt excellently the pleaſantneſſe of the divine knowledge.</p>
               <p>For the nature of this, is to recreate and cherish the fainting ſoule, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the onely ſight of her beauty; but yet much more, if any with a ſerious contemplation, doth fixe the eyes of his minde upon her. The light and glorious brightneſſe of al other thing, as of the Moone and of the Starres, is overwhelmed by the bright-shining beames of a greater light.</p>
               <pb n="686" facs="tcp:6819:351"/>
               <p>The brightneſſe of a ſtone compareth with the ſunne, neither is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but increaſed by the beame therof; even as there is not any glory ſo great that can darken the glorious maieſty of God. The things which are lightſome with us, as torches, lampes, candles, alwayes ſtand in need of ſome matter, wherwith fire is kept burning, otherweiſe they would be turned by and by into darkeneſſe: the ſparkling brightneſſe of a ſtone is naturaly ingendred in it, which hath no need of any outward helpe, but shineth alway by his owne flame, ſo as it repreſenteth before our eyes the eternal light of the moſt High God, in this reſpect alſo. But the Kind of ſtone is alſo expreſſed. For it is <hi>like a Iaſper ſtone cleare as Chryſtall.</hi> The Iaſper is a moſt noble Iewel, both for antiquity and for variety. The like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to cleare ſhining Chryſtal, deſcribeth a certain kind of it, which ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through moſt purely, darkened with no colour. Therfore the Iaſper like Chryſtal, is that kind of Iaſper which is commonly called Aerizula, reſembling the moſt cleare ayre. Here it noteth the moſt excellent glory of God ſhining in this city, which no ſpot of earthly filthineſſe doo make darke, as it is wont to come to paſſe, where any humane invention is pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to Gods ordinances.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Jt had beſide a wall:</hi> Now he expoundeth the matter particularly, &amp; firſt the things which belong to the forme of the wall, which is great and hie; that is, long, broad, and hie, firme on every part. The deſcription wherof had bin ſuperfluous, if it should belong to the heavenly city to be expected after the laſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which al know wel inough to be ſet free from al danger. But the celeſtial Hieruſalem on earth which we have ſeen toſſed with very many ſtormes, from her firſt beginning even unto this day, hath had need of this defence and fortification of walles; leaſt any should feare the ſame thing touching this city, which he knoweth to hav happened to the ſame in former times. But this forme hitherto belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the whole wall. <hi>The parts</hi> are the gates and foundations. The gates ar notable for their number: the watch, the names written upon them in this verſe; then for their moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious ſituation in the thirteenth verſe, which al ar ſo deſcribed, that they may declare a moſt ready way into this city, which no impediment shal hinder. Hereunto firſt of al the twelve gates have reſpect, that an entrance be prepared for every tribe apart, to to the ende that it may be more free and ready. For the ſame purpoſe are the <hi>twelve Angels</hi> being the watch, who doo waite at the gates to open them, and to let in the commers in without delay. What other thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo meane the names written, then to teach, how every one should go on directly, and not looſe any time about ſeeking an entrance.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb n="687" facs="tcp:6819:351"/>13 <hi>On the Eaſt part there were three gates.</hi> The ſituation of the gates is moſt commodious; not all for one quarter, but equal for every one; that a way might be opened on every ſide: &amp; every one might go in directly without being hindred by any crooked turning about. Ezechiel ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling the ſame matter noteth every gate by name: but he beginneth at the North, on which ſide he ſetteth the gates of <hi>Reuben, Iuda, and Levi.</hi> On the Eaſt ſide of <hi>Ioſeph, Beniamin &amp; Dan.</hi> On the South of <hi>Simeon, Jſſachar, Zebulon.</hi> On the Weſt of <hi>Gad, Aſher, Naphthaly,</hi> chap. 48.30. &amp; c, The Iewes in the Eaſt and North part ſhal firſt ſtirre up themſelves, and make haſt to goe into this holy city, as hath bin shewed before chap. 16.12 by <hi>Euphrates dryed, that the way of the Kings of the Eaſt might be prepared.</hi> And as Daniel teacheth, ſpeaking of the iourney undertaken into this city. <hi>But rumours</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhal trouble him from the Eaſt and from the North.</hi> That is, when the Eaſterne &amp; Northerne Iewes are raiſed up, the Turke ſhalbe greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, after he hath received newes of that thing. Therfore becauſe the firſt iourney shall be undertaken from theſe countreyes, the gates of them are put firſt; and thoſe without difference, Iohn attributing the firſt place to them in the Eaſt part, Ezechiel to them in the North, becauſe both ſhal prepare themſelves equally to this expedition. The Southerne Iewes ſhall follow theſe, our in the Weſt shalbe laſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations:</hi> Thus farre the gates: the foundations are deſcribed both by the number &amp; alſo by the names. In number they are twelve, which are laid under the wall: the wall I ſay, not the city, for they are the foundations of miniſtery, not of ſalvation. There is one onely foundation hereof, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt-alone: Other foundation ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man lay beſide that which is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.11. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles may be called the foundations of miniſtery, yet not the principall, but inſtrumental, of which they are not the authours, but the firſt ſtones. For the foundation is not laid of it ſelfe, but of the maiſter builder. Chriſt laied theſe firſt in the bottome of the wall, in which reſpect they are called foundations. So Ezra is called <hi>the foundation of the comming up out of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> becauſe he was the Prince of that ſecond company, which came up togi, ther with him, Ezra 7.9. But how are ther twelve foundations of one wal-wherof ther is wont to be but one? To weet, becauſe any one ſtone is not layed through the whole length and bredth, but there are twelve layed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, one by an other long wayes and broad, the ſame order bein ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>newed, until the building be brought to his ful perfection. No one Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is here for a foundation; but al in equal place and office doo lie in the bottome. That unhappy and wicked boaſting shalbe farre from hence:
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:6819:352"/> 
                  <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rocke,</hi> that is, (as they wil have it who never ſaw this wall, neither have they any ſafegarde from thence,) <hi>upon this the Peter I will build my Church:</hi> this madneſſe of building up the wall upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch one foundation onely, hath greatly troubled the Church of the Gentils, and at length wil make her wholly deſtitute of al wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ In which were the names of tht Lambes twelve Apoſtles:</hi> So as neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that by theſe names ar underſtood not onely thoſe twelve, which wer converſant with Chriſt on earth, but al the faithful Paſtors, which shal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the like office in the Church. They were ſo called before, chap. 18.20. For there is a moſt ſtraight communion of the faithfull, by reaſon wherof the proper names of ſome are applyed to others; but eſpecially to them who beſide the common bond, have alſo an other fellowship of office. But if the Apoſtles be the foundations, this is not that eternall city in the heavens. <hi>For Chriſt then ſhal deliver up the Kingdome to his Father, and God ſhalbe all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.24. Neither shal the Saints have any miniſtery of teaching there, 1 Cor. 15.8. Therfore this wall belongeth to the Church being a ſtranger on earth, not unto that reigning in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Moreover he that ſpake with mee:</hi> Hitherto the forme of the wall, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the continued quantity: there followeth of the city; the forme wherof he delivereth, both the continued, and the ſevered, togither; and firſt univer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſally as touching the miniſter, and inſtrument, and the things to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, in this verſe. The Miniſter is the ſame which ſpake with Iohn, the ſeventh Angel of thoſe to whom were given the vials, ver. 9. Whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour biddeth us to ſeeke this city, before the laſt iudgement. And ſome excellent man ſeemeth to be noted by this Angel; who as a ſecond Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel, Ezra, or Nehemiah: shall appoint, from God, this moſt excellent policie, and shal deſcribe moſt exactly every part of the holy city. <hi>The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> is <hi>a golden reede,</hi> shewing that the deſcription of the whole frame ſhall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be farre moſt pretious. The thing to be meaſured is <hi>the city, gates, wall,</hi> that is, the whole building. No part shalbe neglected, but every one, both moſt diligently aſsigned, and moſt wiſely builded. In the Hieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gentils, when the Beaſt began to appeare, the temple onely was meaſured, the deſcription of the city was forbidden, and alſo of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward court; but this Angel wil meaſure both the city and gates and walls, and shal recal the whole government of the Church unto the exact rule of Gods will.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>And the city lay foure ſquarre:</hi> Now he sheweth the forme of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſuch as the continued kind of it giveth. It is foure ſquarre, &amp; ſo great in length as in breadth. This city therfore shalbe moſt ſtable, ſo prepared
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:6819:352"/> againſt al alteration, that her foundation be alwayes ſtable. There is an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther conſideration of this, then was of our Ieruſalem, which lay hid amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g us Gentils for a thouſand two hundred threeſcore yeeres: which had alſo a foureſquare figure, but of unequal ſides, as we have shewed at the ſeven chapter, having in length twelve times a thouſand, but in breadth onely twelve thouſand. Of both which conſiſted that whole number of <hi>an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and foure and fourty thouſand of them that were ſealed.</hi> For there was ſome multitude of the godly at that time in lenght of continuance: but the Church did flouriſh in no breadth and preſent aboundance in any age, by al that intervalle. But in this city it shal come to paſſe otherweiſe It ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be made famous no leſſe for the great multitude of the faithful, through every preſent age, as for a moſt happy propagation of a long time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And he meaſured the city with a reede twelve thouſand furlongs:</hi> Such then is the forme of the continued quantity: now followeth of that which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vered: and firſt of the city, whoſe dimenſion is about twelve thouſand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs: which, it is doubtful, whither they belong to the whole plat of ground, or onely to the compas. There is nothing, that can be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certenly and diſtinctly touching this thing. If we ſay the firſt, it is a huge city, every ſide of which shalbe an hundred and nine furlongs, and more, lacking a very little of the old Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which conteined a hundred and twenty furlongs in every ſide, as Herodotus in Clio sheweth. But if the compas alone receiveth this meaſure, there was never any city to be compared with this in greatneſſe, every ſide wherof shalbe three thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d furlongs in lenght, and the whole plat of ground nine times tenne hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand. The Complutent edition, whom Montanus and Plantins Bible follow, reade theſe things otherweiſe, thus, <hi>about twelve furlongs of twelve thouſand,</hi> that is as I ſuppoſe, about twelve times twelve thouſand furlongs, as if the whole largeneſſe were ſo many furlongs, as many as wer ſealed of every tribe, ch. 7. to weet, <hi>an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred fourty &amp; foure thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d furlongs.</hi> Which agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſeth to doubt that this reading is the truer, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it declareth the great ſimilitude of this &amp; the old Church of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils, &amp; alſo becauſe it retaineth the proportion of the wal, in ver. follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By this meane the city is made of the mutual increaſe of the cityzens &amp; miniſters, as the wal of the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the miniſters multiplyed in it ſelfe: for 12 tims 12 thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, of which that multiplying ſignifieth the miniſters, this to be multiplyed, the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, do mak this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber; whoſe ſide ſhal be of 379 furlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs &amp; above. But here it may be asked, why Iohn maketh this city much larger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ezech. ſeing it is the ſame in both. For he rehearſeth the meaſure of ech ſide 4500 cubits, ch. 48.30, that is 12 furlongs onely and ſome what more:</p>
               <pb n="690" facs="tcp:6819:353"/>
               <p>Iohn which reading ſoever we folow, whether we eſteeme the meaſure of the circuit, or the plat of ground, aſsigned a farre greater magnitude. Ezechiel was a miniſter of the Law, Iohn of the Goſpel: from whence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a difference of ampleneſſe according to the allowed portion of light, which alwayes was greater, the nigher men approached to the times of Chriſt. Wherfore the Temple of Salomon was built with la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ger dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the Tabernacle: and the Temple of Ezechiel, with farre greater than that of Salomon: but this ciry of Iohn with a great deale larger than of Ezechiel. For after Chriſts comming there came a very great light, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which increaſe of knowledge, ther is uſed an anſwerable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence of the building.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the length, and bredth, and height of it are equall:</hi> Even now we ſaid, that the length is continuance of time: the bredth the preſent face of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, which shalbe no leſſe faire and beautiful, then that glory of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation. Now firſt mention is made of height: which ſerveth to betoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and excellent glory of this city, to be extolled by the ſpeach and praiſes of al men. Things are ſet on high by commendations; wherby, as it is much uſed in common ſpeach, <hi>they are lifted up to heaven.</hi> Therfore this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shalbe no leſſe famous among al, then durable in time, &amp; alwayes flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing in a great multitude of citizens. For this city is ſolid, not ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary, proportionable, &amp; foure ſquarre on every part, which conſiſteth of al her meaſures, and al of them equal. It is perfect every way, to which nothing can be added. The former wanted ſolidity, whoſe bredth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was ſo narrow, that it could ſcarce be ſeen. What marveile therfore, if they were shaken with every tempeſt? This more firme shal ſtande with ſo great ſtrength on every ſide, that it cannot feare any ſtormes</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>And he meaſured the wall of it:</hi> Such then is the forme of the city. The quantity of the wall a part is of an hundred fourty foure cubits. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is this number? From the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Apoſtles, multiplied in it ſelfe: for twelve times twelve doo make this number. VVherfore the Apoſtles, and the Miniſtere of the word who are propagated from them, shal compaſſe the holy city round about, and shal keepe it ſafe from al invaſion of the enemy, and from al the fraud and deceit of Heretiques. But this meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is onely the height; that of the length may be known well ynough be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing shewed by the meaſure of the city: which the wal compaſsing the ſame doth exceed, becauſe of the territories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ The meaſure of a man, which is of the Angell:</hi> As though he should ſay Though the Miniſters shal make this deſcription with their cubite, yet they shal doo nothing at their owne pleaſure, but as the Angels of God,
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:6819:353"/> ſhal reſpect Gods wil in al things, and shal follow the ſame moſt happilye having the Spirit for their guide; but what should the <hi>meaſure of a man</hi> doo in heaven? obſerve therfore what city he deſcribeth unto us.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>And the building of the wall was:</hi> Thus farre of the forme: now he ſpeaketh of the matter; and firſt iointly of the matter of the wall, &amp; togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the city. The frame of the wall is of Iaſper. This ſtone both lyeth in the foundation, and is uſed chiefly in the reſt of the building: perhaps becauſe <hi>endomeſis</hi> in greeke, is the ſtuffing of the wall, filling up the ſpace between the fronts; that it may ſignify, the frame to be no leſſe pretious within then without: the ſtopping which the word noteth, ſeemeth to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify ſome ſuch thing: or rather ſeing <hi>procumation</hi> is alſo a pile or dam laid for to repell and breake the waves, the building is chiefly made of Iaſper, becauſe thoſe teachers, which are ſignifyed by this gemme, shal endure the chiefe violence, and firſt aſſault of the adverſaries, being in ſtead of a fortreſſe to the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ But the city it ſelfe was pure gold:</hi> The matter in ſumme of the city, is pure golde, which the fire conſumeth not, but maketh it more bright; neither weareth away with uſe, neither is defiled by the ruſt, neither is overcome, either by the juices of ſalt or vineger, which doo overcome other things. Plinie giveth thoſe praiſes to gold. Why should not this city be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which is made of matter ſo invincible, and is free from all corruption? But beſide it is like to <hi>cleare glaſſe,</hi> that is, not loathſome to looke on by the deformity of any filth, even in the moſt ſecret corner. So wholly clear it ſhineth through, that in it and through it, every one may beholde the moſt favourable face of God. For hereunto tendeth this ſhining cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that God himſelfe may be conſidered and ſeen through it, whom as ſtrangers on earth, we behold through a glaſſe, and riddle, 1 Cor. 13.12. Therfore this city is not, (as at this day <hi>Rome the whore,</hi>) gilded with golde wholly without, and within full of filthineſſe, and al manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption: but it hath exceeding great purity and holineſſe ioyned with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great dignity, and maieſty. Which marchandiſe, the more rare it is, the more glorious it shal at length be.</p>
               <p n="19">19 20 <hi>And the foundation of the wall of the city:</hi> He commeth to declare the foundations of the wall one after an other: in deſcribing wherof he re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteth not in the very loweſt ground ſellings; but teacheth that the matter of the whole frame is farre moſt pretious: as altogether conſiſting of moſt noble pearles, neither is it any thing inferiour to that moſt divine forme, of which wee heard before. I am not ignorant how greatly the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters labour in applying every one of theſe to the auncient Apoſtles; which
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:6819:354"/> difficulty this ſo exquiſite order increaſeth, conſidering that there is not any certain order of the Apoſtles kept, eyther in the Ghoſpels, or in the Actes; but ſometime one Apoſtle, ſometime another, is reckened firſt; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence it becometh altogither uncertaine, what ſtone may be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to which. But it ſeemeth that the Holy Ghoſt intendeth another thing in this place; not purpoſing to deſcribe unto us the firſt twelve Apoſtles, but the future teachers of the Iewes Church: who carry the names of the Apoſtles, whom they shall ſucceed both in office and fellowship of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as before in the 14. verſe, and in chap, 18.20. All faithful teachers are the Apoſtles ofſpring, as alſo the former verſe taught, which made the greatnes of the wall, of the number of twelve multiplyed in it ſelfe. It is certain that the excellency of gifts, by which the teachers doo excell abov the reſt, are ſignified here by moſt pretious earthly things; by which more over it is taught, both in what reckening they are with God, and alſo in what eſtimation they ought to be with men. And it is no leſſe certen that every one of theſe excellent vertues shined forth in the old Apoſtles long time paſt; but I thinke that the order belongeth properly to the future Teachers, which if we shal apply to thoſe auncient ones, perhaps we shall erre greatly by attributing to every each one, that which is unfit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſting as much as in us lay, in the proper drift of this place, beſide that excellency, which is common to all the pearles, we think that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act a reckening doth perteine to the order, in which at length theſe new preachers of the Ghoſpell shall ariſe; that even as the ſituation of the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes shewed the order of the countreyes, in which the Iewes shalbe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the truth: ſo this manner of ſtones ſo ſet in order, may ſignify the riſing of the teachers in what order they shal riſe up from every place. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there is this difference between the people and the teachers, that the people aſſemble by troupes in every ſide of the city, and therfore shall have three gates opened to them on every ſide; the Teachers being fewer, shall not gather togither by multitudes, but shalbe numbred man by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the ſtate of the places where God shal riſe them up. Yet we may not think that theſe shalbe but twelve, but that there shalbe perhaps ſo many chiefe, to whom the other multitude shalbe wholly like. Let us ſee therfore where theſe Gemmes growe, and of what ſort they are, that in ſome meaſure wee may coniecture of the originall and diſpoſition of thoſe excellent men, whom the divine bounteouſnes wil give within theſe few yeeres.</p>
               <p>The firſt foundation is a <hi>Iaſper,</hi> a divine ſtone, often repreſenting, (as we have ſeen) the Image of God himſelfe; worthily occupying the firſt
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:6819:354"/> place, becauſe he that shal beginne the firſt reſtoring of the Iewes, as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moſes shal come moſt neere to God himſelfe, by a ſingular excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of gifts. The beginnings are moſt hard, and require men very greatly furnished. It is a Scythian and Perſian Gemme, of a celeſtial brightnes, in which reſpect a certen kind of it is called <hi>Borea</hi> &amp; <hi>Aerizuſa,</hi> the beautie whereof can more eaſily be admired than declared: it hath a pleaſantneſſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful of variety, which the moſt sharpe eyed can not diſtinguish. It may ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore repreſent a mixt riches of gifts, wherein a manifold excellency is ſeen, yet it cannot be diſerned, which moſt of all excelleth, in which reſpect it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gureth the Godhead as in chap. 9.3. in that ſo mixt faireneſſe should ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify in ſome meaſure that incomprehenſible depth. The <hi>Saphyre</hi> gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with golden points, in great account among the Medes, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a certen &amp; diſtinct kind of delectableneſſe, ſuch as shal be in the next teachers after the firſt, whom the excellency of ſome ſingular gift shall make famous. <hi>A Chalcedonie,</hi> is of a ſimple colour, like to a Carbuncle, ſhining with a fiery brightneſſe: it is a Northern Iewell; found about the narrow ſea of Chalcedon beaond Chryſopolis, night to the rockes called Symplegades, from whence it hath the name; this betokeneth zeale &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency. The moſt noble <hi>Emeraude</hi> groweth in Scythia, it is of a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant green, neither doth any thing more delight the eyes. But ſeeing here inward graces are more regarded, then outward, this greenneſſe is a moſt divine knowledge of things, upon which the minde deſireth to faſten the eyes before all things: It is ſet after the Chalcedone, that knowledge may accompany zeale.</p>
               <p>The fift foundation is a <hi>Sardonix,</hi> which is an Indian Iewel, shining like the naile of a man ſet upon fleſh: it sheweth a certen kinde of humanitie, having whiteneſſe mixed with redneſſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sardius</hi> is found in <hi>Sardes,</hi> it is wholly redde with bloody colour: it may betoken a certen ſeverity, profitably ioyned with the Sardonix, leaſt perhaps gentleneſſe should be deſpiſed without this companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And theſe ſixt firſt ſtones are belonging to the Eaſt and North: which doo shew a happy encreaſe of Teachers from theſe regions: which wee ſee how it agreeth with the former thinges, when the firſt people shall be revived out of theſe ſame countreyes.</p>
               <p>The ſeaventh foundation is a <hi>Chryſolite,</hi> which shineth through with a golden colour: It is a Iewell ful of dignity and maieſty. AETHIOPIA bringeth forth the ſame. PLINIVS affirmeth that the <hi>Beryll</hi> is found in INDIA: DIONYSIVS in his book intituled <hi>Perieg,</hi> ſaith that it groweth alſo in the land of BABYLON, of a skie and water colour,
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:6819:355"/> as the ſame deſcribeth, <hi>the skie coloured ſtone of the wet Beryll, which groweth in the field of Babylon.</hi> The watery colour belongeth to lenity and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as is the water it ſelfe, which eaſily giveth place to every thing; a moſt fit companion of the maieſty of the Chryſolite, that it may containe it within meaſure. The ninth foundation is a <hi>Topaze;</hi> which with Plinie is a green Iewel, it is found among the Troglodites, which dwel by the redde ſea. Dionyſius ſaith that it is found in india, <hi>or the ſtone of the bright Topaze ſhining with a skie colour,</hi> writing of India. But it is not of a ſimple and pure greennes, but yellowiſh and gliſtering like gold. From whence Euſtachius attributeth unto it a golden colour, <hi>chruſoeides, yellow,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſendeth forth a golden colour,</hi> which he borrowed out of Strabo, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are many things touching this ſtone, in his 16. book. Some from hence coniecture, that it tooke the name from the Hebrew word <hi>Pazaz,</hi> as though at the firſt it had bin <hi>to Paz,</hi> or in greek <hi>to Pazion,</hi> and at length by the ignorance of the printers to have grown togither, and made one word <hi>topazion.</hi> The <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus</hi> alſo, as the name sheweth, doth reſemble a certaine kind of Gold, but as it were be ſmeared with the iuice of leekes. The eleventh &amp; twelfth foundation is the <hi>Iacynth</hi> &amp; <hi>Amethyſt,</hi> both of a purple colour, but the firſt ſhining more brightly, the ſecond of a a more wanne and weake co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as Dionyſius sheweth, <hi>and the ſweet Amethyſt ſhining as aſaied purple:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia and Aethiopia doo afford theſe two. Therfore theſe laſt ſixe belong to the Eaſt and South. Our Weſt part, as it ſeemeth, shal miniſter citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, even as other countreys, but shal give few, or no Iewels, for the building up of the wall. It may be that God wil ſo ſet forth his power the more, in raiſing up teachers from thoſe places, which are moſt repugnant to his truth. The foure laſt gemmes are like gold and purple, which colours are of a very great price and dignity: which the Spirit ſeemeth to have put in the laſt places for a certain purpoſe, and that by a courſe twice doubled: as though he would teach by the ſame thing, that thoſe teachers shal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be loathed, but shal alwayes flourish in very great authority. At the firſt the truth is wont to be acceptable, and the miniſters of it are iudged worthy of al honour; but in time the good wil of men waxeth cold, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authority of the teachers decayeth, after that men beginne to be full. But here no ſuch thing shal come to paſſe. The end shalbe anſwerable to the beginning. The diſpenſers of the word shalbe no leſſe honourable, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the truth through many ages hath waxed olde, then when at the firſt it began. And for this cauſe, I thick, was ſo great a plenty of golden and purple colour put to the laſt place. I know that other doo ſeek out an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of other properties in theſe ſtones; but ſeeing authours varie
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:6819:355"/> greatly about this, what is the proper force of every one, neither is the thing as yet ſufficiently cleared: I had rather follow things that are plain and of a known ſignification; and alſo the congruency of the Prophecy, then looſe my labour in doubtful things. So therfore that which Daniell hath comprehendeth briefly in one word, <hi>they that inſtruct ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament, and they that iuſtify many ſhallbe as the ſtarres for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ever,</hi> chap. 12.3. the ſame we have here declared peculiarly and more at large by ſundry kindes of Iewels.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>And the twelve gates are:</hi> Hitherto hath bin the matter of the walls: The gates are made of pearles, which ſignify Chriſt, <hi>who is the way &amp; doore to life: if any ſhall enter in by him, he ſhallbe ſaved, and he ſhall goe in and out, and finde paſture,</hi> Iohn 10.9. But how notably doo the pearles repreſente the Sonne of God conceived in the wombe of the virgin? which are not bred of any earthly copulation, but inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred of a celeſtial dew, as of a husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For they report that the ſhell fiſhes at a certain time of the yeere, with a certain gaping, after that they have drunke up a dewing from heaven, doo conceive, and become great with yong, and the more that they have bin toſſed with great tempeſts, after the dew received, the more noble fruit doo they bring forth: ſo the Holy Ghoſt came upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mary, and the power of the moſt high overshadowed her; and Chriſt ſcarce brought forth into the light, was ſought for to be put to death, and by an horrible ſtorme was driven into Aegypt. After the ſame manner the firſt entrance into this city shalbe very laborious, but of ſo much the more aboundant praiſe &amp; account, after they have entred. There are twelve gates, but every one of one pearle, becauſe <hi>there is but one Chriſt, and but one onely name given under heaven, by which we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Act. 4.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the ſtreet of the city was pure golde:</hi> In the laſt place he addeth the matter of the city: which before, he ſaid was golde: but there he made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the whole city in general; here in ſpecial <hi>of the ſtreets.</hi> Theſe are the publik wayes, wherin the citizens doo meete, if one have ought to doo with an other. Even as therfore the wayes of man are the actions, in which man is occupied: ſo the ſtreetes of the city, are thoſe publike offices of life and buyings and ſellings, in which the citizens doo take paines. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith that al theſe things shalbe holy, pure, cleane, pretious. For the place of aſſembling, where theſe buſineſſes are handled, is pure gold, and ſhining through, as before ver. 18. How holy and unblameable shal this city be, where the common life, then which nothing is wont to be more foule and polluted, shalbe free from al filth of wickednes? Righteouſnes now, as a river shall run through the ſtreetes, and godlineſſe ſhal ſhine in
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:6819:356"/> all affaires.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>Neither ſaw I any Temple in her:</hi> Hitherto we have ſeen the inward &amp; eſſential glory of the city, as farre as is given us, who doo not behold fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hie mountaine, but a farre off from a low and preſſed down valley: wher hilles and trees doo much hinder our eyes, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not yet ſee the thing cleerly. Yet it delighteth mee, as once Daniell to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his window twards Hieruſalem, ſo to looke from farr off into this holy city, whoſe cloudie, and blackish toppes to behold a farr off, it much recreateth my ſoule. Now the Spirit teacheth how great dignity shall come from things out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Firſt <hi>God the Father and the Lambe his Sonne</hi> in ſtead of a Temple, that is, then shal the worship be moſt ſimple and moſt pure, darkened with no legal ceremonies, which once God ordained, until the time of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, much leſſe with any humane inventions, but ſuch as shal exhibit Gods preſence moſt ſimply and familiarly. How then doth this agree with Ezechiel, who in eight whole chapters from the fourtieth to the end of the Prophecy, ſpeaking of this very time, deſcribeth ſo exactly the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the city, and whole legal worship? Very wel: for that whole deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption tendeth to that ende, not to teach that the old ceremonies are to be reſtored, but that at lenght they being wholly abolished, Chriſt shalbe worshipped moſt purely and exactly according to his owne ordinances alone. For what other thing mean the new meaſurings of the walles, gates porches, and the whole building, the new diſtribution of the holy land, and the new portions given to the tribes, Prieſts, Levites, Prince, then an abrogation of Moſes and al the legal ceremonies? But that time was not otherweiſe capable of any ſpiritual worship, then under thoſe shadowes. Iohn ſpeaketh playnly to Chriſtians, al coverings being removed, as on whom the noone Sunne of truth shineth, and all things are naked and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. And indeed he openeth moſt ſignificantly in one word that long &amp; obſcure deſcription in Ezechiel, ſaying that <hi>that temple ſo magnifically &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly prepared, is in truth none at all:</hi> not as though the Prophet had utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo many words vainly, but to ſhewe that we muſt not ſtick in the bark of the lettre, but that the kernell of the Spirit is to be found out. Let the Iewes heare, neither let them expect a renewed temple, as hitherto they doo, amiſſe and obſtinately, but let them with minds and harts aſpire in that right way, which shal need no temple. Let them look for the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God and the Lamb to dwel among them, in compariſon of which glory, whatſoever can be built of men shalbe vile.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>Neither hath this city any need of the Sunne or Moone; For in very deed the Moone ſhallbe aſhamed, and the very Sunne ſhall bluſh, when the Lord of hoſts

And why may it not be ashamed of her former darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when <hi>the light of the Moone shalbe as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne ſeven folde as the light of ſeven daies,</hi> Iſay 30.23. Which thinges are not ſpoken to that ende, as though there should be no uſe then of the Scriptures; but becauſe all shall ſo underſtand Gods will, as if they had no need to learne wiſdome from books. <hi>Full,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>shall this land be of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters covering the chanell of the Sea,</hi> Iſay 11.9. <hi>Neither shall they anie more teach everie man his friend, and everie man his brother, ſaying, know yee the Lord, for they shall all know mee, from the leaſt of them even to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord: that J doo forgive their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and remember their ſinne no more,</hi> Ier. 31.34. From hence let us obſerv that that Church is moſt glorious, in which the ſunne of righteouſneſſe shineth with moſt open face, covered with no cloudes of ceremonies; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore let them ſee in how great errour they are, whom bring in a pompous shew of ceremonies, to procure authority to religion with the people. Furthermore let us note to what times Iohn applyeth the ſentences of the Prophets, that we may know the things are yet to come, which we inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret commonly to be paſt, and not onely in the heavenly countrey, whoſe happineſſe needeth the words of no man, but here in earth in that reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wherof we have ſpoken.</p>

                  <hi>¶ And the Lambe is the light therof:</hi> Therfore this light, the moſt bright of all godly times, shal not yet be perfit, as it shalbe after this life, but a candle onely in reſpect of that; leaſt peradventure wee should reſt in our iourney, as if we had come to the laſt ende.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>And the Gentiles that ſhalbe ſaved.</hi> The ſecond outward argument is glory from the Gentils. Before time the Iewes have alwayes found the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are not al generally, but are limited with a certain kinde, <hi>which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>shalbe ſaved:</hi> which word is inſerted for an expoſition. The place is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of Iſaiah, 60.3. where it is thus, <hi>and the Gentiles shall walke to thy light,</hi> which Iohn draweth to the elect, by putting in of one word, leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should think it was ſpoken of every one generally.

Did the man dreame waking when he wrote theſe things, that he would hav any ſuch thing to be deſired in the future ſtate? But I wil not vexe the man, being as it ſeemeth, ſick of an ague.</p>

But as touching the <hi>water,</hi> it is not ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fountaine, but a river: neither corrupted and troubled as <hi>Nilus,</hi> but flowing with moſt pure waters as Kidron &amp; Gallirrhoe <hi>making glad the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God,</hi> Pſal 46.5. Furthermore it is a river of <hi>water of life,</hi> not onely becauſe of the continuance, for it runneth alwayes with new waters, as is the water of a fountaine or ſpring, which alſo in the Scriptures is called li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but becauſe it bringeth <hi>life to the drinkers</hi> Iohn 4.14. <hi>The river is ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as Chryſtall,</hi> farre exceeding the clearnes of the fountaines. Laſtly it <hi>proceedeth out of the throne of God and of the Lambe,</hi> which it hath for chiefe fountaines, and to which againe as a companion it doth leade, or rather being a forerunner, goeth before, as a ſtreeme to the ſea. In Ezechiel the ſame flood iſſueth out of the temple &amp; altar, chap. 47.1. But in this new Ieruſalem there is no temple, as hath bin ſpoken in chap. 21.22. &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of God is ſet in the place thereof.

So in Ioel <hi>there ſhal iſſue forth a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from the houſe of the Lord and ſhall water the valley of Shittim,</hi> chap. 3.18. That is, the plaine of Moab; where the Iſraelites committed whordome with the Moabitiſh wemen, Numb. 25.1. Zacharie alſo, <hi>There ſhalbe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in that daie waters of life going forth out of Ieruſalem, part of them to the Eaſt ſea, and parte of them to the uttermoſt ſea, which shalbe both in ſomer and winter,</hi> chap. 14.8. This river is the moſt fruitfull doctrine of Chriſt, which ſhall flowe forth towards the Eaſt, becauſe the people watered with the moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture hereof shall grow, and at laſt true life shall budde forth. <hi>For every living creature that creepeth, wherſoever theſe rivers come, shall live, and there shal be a very great multitude of fishes, for by the comming of theſe waters thither, they are cured and live, wherſoever this river commeth,</hi> Ezech. 47.9.

And ſo it is one tree, wherof there is a more manifeſt alluſion to the tree of life, Gen. 3.1. and of which he hath made mention before, in chap. 2.7. <hi>to him that over commeth I will give to eat of that tree of life, which is in the middeſt of the paradiſe of God.</hi> Iohn ſaw this tree to be one, becauſe there is one common foode of life for all the elect, 1 Cor. 10.3.4.

               <p>

Whereto alſo ſeeme to appertaine thoſe ſo diverſe kindes of offerings, which once were offered with the ſacrifices: ſome of which were raw, ſome ſodden, ſome drie, ſome with liquor, certaine ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, certaine fried, certaine alſo roſted, Lev. 2. ſo doth Chriſt provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our lothſomenes, who in fruit being the ſame meat, doth in taſt yeilde himſelfe ſo ſondrie &amp; manifoulde. <hi>Every moneth bringing forth fruit;</hi> word for word in the greek is <hi>by every one moneth.</hi> This meat never faile, but growes daylie new. There needs not here, that in harveſt it be laide up for an other yeare, but there shalbe a continual ſpring &amp; harveſt, alwayes with ſome ripe fruites, and ſome other budding: as the orenge tree; which forthwith as the firſt apples by reaſon of their ripenes fall off, afterwards it bud des with new apples. But wer the trees ſo created in the beginning,
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:6819:360"/> as that if ſinne had never entred, which hath brought thornes, thiſtles, ſweat of the browes, and painfulnes of living, they should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and be loaden with fruites? This alluſion ſeemes to point out ſuch a thing. And it may be Chriſt would not have curſed the figge tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wanted fruite, when the time of figges was not, unleſſe by his firſt nature it ought to have them at all times, Mar. 11.13. but I dare not med<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle any whit at all to determine of this matter; neither would I willingly buſie my ſelfe with this ſort of queſtions, except perhaps that I might bring light to a darke place.</p>

In time paſt he forſooke the auncient Ieruſalem: &amp; Rome shal in vaine boaſt that shee shall never be a widow, as chapter 18.7. but he hath choſen this mountaine Zion, in which he will dwel for ever. But that we may not thinke that this is to be attributed to any holines of the,

But this confirmation is common to the whole booke, and therfore ſeemeth to be of that Angell which was ſent in the beginning, that manifeſted theſe things to Iohn. Next alſo it is likely, that here are not againe words uttered by the voice of the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Certainly the coniunction of things without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulatives, or any neceſſary coherence between themſelves, ſeemeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of ſuch an account. Which meaning if we follow, the words ar not to be tranſlated, <hi>then he ſaid to mee,</hi> which declare the time of a new ſpeach begunne after the ſight of the city, but <hi>and he ſaid to mee,</hi> as though he ſhould ſay; ſeeing that now I have fully delivered to you al things, which are revealed to mee, that shal be, now ther remaineth nothing, but that with ſure faith ye embrace the ſame: which that you may the more eaſilie doo, bethinke ye how holily and religiouſlly the Angel hath confirmed the ſame to mee, <hi>thoſe words are faithfull and true.</hi> Wherfore this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angel apperteineth not onely to thoſe things which went next before, of the new Ieruſalem, although the demonſtrative proouune be ſo uſed often, but likewiſe to the whole booke: as alſo that threatening, which followeth ver. 18.19. univerſally challengeth credit to the whole Prophecy, and not for the authority of ſome certaine part of it. Theſe things are repeated out of the 19 chap. ver. 9. &amp; by the words of Iohn ſpeaking, which the Angel had before ſpoken, they are applyed to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the whole Revelation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ And the Lord God of the holy Prophets ſent his Angell.</hi> Neither did the Angel of his owne accord utter, <hi>theſe words are faithful &amp; true,</hi> but by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and authority of God the ſander. The ſame God which inſpired the auncient Prophets, that they might moſt certenly foreſpeake of things to come, he ſent this Angell, which might reveale thoſe thinges to Iohn for the uſe of the Church. Theſe things are repeated out of the 1. chap. 1 ver. <hi>which Revelation he ſignified, when he ſent by his Angell to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Iohn.</hi> But thou maieſt obſerve that this latter member of the verſe is
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:6819:362"/> ſo inferred, that it may clearly shew that theſe now are not the words of the Angell ſpeaking, but of Iohn repeating the arguments of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy delivered from heaven.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Behold I come quickly;</hi> The teſtimony of Ieſus concerning the ſpeedy execution of theſe things, fetched out of the 11. chapter, <hi>which muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done:</hi> and againe, <hi>the time is neare</hi> ver. 3. The event of things next paſt, should give credit to things that follow: and therfore he maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ſpeedy execution: as if he should ſay, take every one of you, for every of your ages a pledge, and as it were a fuerty of things to come, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſent things, which thou shalt ſee to come to paſſe. Theſe things aſſure you that the things to come are no leſſe certain. But we who now for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and five hundred yeares, to weet, from Iohn, have ſeen the conſent of the event and Prophecy, may not any more doubt of theſe few other things which as yet remaine.

               <p n="8">8 <hi>And J Iohn:</hi> A confirmation from the Miniſters. It is a moſt ſure pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phecy, whoſe Miniſter the Angel was, and of ſo great maieſty, that Iohn the Apoſtle thought to worshippe him, and of that holines that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the worshippe offered.

               <p>
                  <hi>¶ But he ſaid to mee:</hi> in the greek it is, <hi>and he ſaieth to mee,</hi> for <hi>he ſaid to mee,</hi> or <hi>hath ſaide,</hi> as well the interpreters do tranſlate it: he relateth not a new, but a thing paſt But we muſt marke that which he ſpake before, <hi>and of thy brethren which have the teſtimony of Jeſus:</hi> chap. 19.10. here it is uttered in other words, <hi>and of thy brethren the Prophets. &amp; of them which keepe the words of this book.</hi> Therfore to keepe the words of this book is to have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Ieſus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>¶ Seale not:</hi> The publishing of a commaundement, wherby ther should be free power to every one to examine, and, by the ſucceſſe to iudge of the Prophecy. Iohn might not have it for himſelfe alone, but should offer it to the trial of a publique examination, as forthwith from the beginning he was bidden: <hi>That which thou ſeeſt write in a booke, and ſend it to the ſeven Churches,</hi> chap. 1.11. And againe, <hi>write theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, &amp; which are, and which shalbe:</hi> that is, hide it not from others, but publiſh it. But if the publicke publishing of it be onely reſpected, how was Daniell
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:6819:362"/> commaunded <hi>to ſhut up his words, and to ſeale the booke,</hi> who alſo brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open view his Prophecy? Therfore this prohibition of not ſealing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth ſome other thing; namely, that things to come are in ſuch ſorte ſet downe, that men by the events preſent and neere at hande, might be ledde as by the hand, fully to underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſame Prophecie: which chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced otherweiſe to Daniell, who was not manifeſt to every age, for he light<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly touching things interlaced, is chiefly imployed in things that should laſtly come to paſte, and therfore should expect the appointed time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which it was not to be unfolded: which partly is to be underſtood of thoſe more difficult viſions; partly of the people of the Iewes, whom that Prophecy doth chiefly reſpect. That which followeth confirmeth this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>for the time is at hand:</hi> as if he should ſay, ſhutte not up this Prophecy, becauſe the time neare at hand shall reveale it: but Daniels was ſealed up, for the event farre to comme, cauſed, that for a great time it should lie hidden. Therfore theſe words have the ſame force, as the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Behold I come quickly.</hi>

Therfore they might demaunde, how he would come quickly, who ſo long forbeareth the wicked? He then meetes with it, and warneth that no man take this in ill part, but minde that the ungodly will continue in their wickednes, and the righteous will follow after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes: but that there are certen boundes ſet them, beiond which they can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not goe: neither muſt they wonder that a certaine increaſe of wickednes is permitted for a determined time, for the greater condemnation of the ungodly: but they are to leave thoſe men and to turne their eies to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, whoſe conſtant ſtudy of godlines ought to ſtrenghten our wavering mindes againſt all ſtiffenes of the reprobate. Therfore theſe are not the words of one exhorting, but of one conforting, and admonishing, that by thoſe ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dales our expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not diminiſhed, ſeeing that ther shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ſuch a ſtate of things, even to the laſt end.</p>
